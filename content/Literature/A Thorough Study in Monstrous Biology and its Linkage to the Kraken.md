Perhaps the oldest surviving document on Attovia still used in academics. As far as anyone knows only a single copy ever existed, and its author Valo Rehn is a historically unknown figure. Despite this, the book contains documented research on Monster Biology that to this day has yet to be repeated. Some experiments described within are exceedingly dangerous or require one to get their hands on live samples of very rare creatures. Those experiments that have been successfully recreated have consistently proven the books legitimacy.
