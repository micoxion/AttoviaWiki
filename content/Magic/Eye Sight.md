One well known side effect of Divine [[Meyda]]-Work is the restoration of 20/20 vision. A by product of the [[Church of Hormus]] offering structured charitable healing has made vision problems relatively rare and only found in small hamlets substantially distanced from any temple. Some species such as the [[Elves]] and [[Rugadh Sliabh]] do not suffer from age related vision decay, thus only suffering from optic related troubles when injurious or genetic.
