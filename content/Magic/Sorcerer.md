All other forms of magical power sought by the people of Attovia require proactivity in the [[Contracts]] involved. The Wizard and their ritualistic casting, a warlock and his pact, the paladin and her oath. Not so for the sorcerer. They are born with direct access to [[Meyda]] with no regards to their own will. This generally occurs when the mother or father have a direct **[[Tethers|tether]]** to a deity or other powerful being that is then passed on to the child via a [[Contracts#Contract of Birth|Contract of Birth]]. There are a number of other ways this can occur, none of which are any less remarkable or rare, and the resulting being will leave their mark on the world one way or another. This provides sorcerer's with a more intimate understanding of Meyda-work. This intuitive access to the casting process means that very practiced sorcerers can begin to play with, and alter the different portions of the Meyda they inform to create surprising and unique effects to very typical spells.
