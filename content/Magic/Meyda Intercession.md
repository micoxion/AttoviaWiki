When a [[Those who Work Meyda|worker]] of [[Meyda]] **[[Tethers|tethers]]** their [[Soul]] to an [[Olam Beyn]] or similarly powerful [[Dragons|creature]] a symbiotic relationship forms. The Meyda-worker receives a well of Meyda to pull from when casting spells, and the god-like entity becomes more "substantial" in some small way. In addition to a well of power, the caster may now work Meyda with a kind of shorthand. This shorthand depends on the type of entity one has **tethered** their Soul to. Generally similar enough that spells may be transcribed between Meyda-workers, the purpose of the shorthand is to first inform the **tethered** being of what action is required so that it may inform the Meyda fully.
This further explains the complexity required for the vast majority of Meyda-circles. Since they are powered solely by Meyda and mortal Souls they must be much less ambiguous in their informing.

I'm afraid the laws of Meyda Intercession dictate that a being of significant power resides within the very walls of [[Zyclest City]]. Whether through physical or exceptional means, it warrants proper consideration.

# Deals with Dragons
What then does a Dragon receive from connecting their Soul to a collection of mortals? After all their substance seems... substantial, to say the least. 
Dragon's are obsessed with changing their status as [[Mach'shavah Chofesh]]. Each **tethered** Soul is a potential touch point for this change, and brings them more influence. The additional strain it creates on their Souls continues to increase their Soul's strength. Perhaps, with enough such **tethers** they can finally break the shackle [[Graskoroth|Graskoroth's]] Soul binds them with.
