Wizards hold no well of [[Meyda]] within themselves and do not have access to one from birth such as the [[Meyda-Born]]. Instead they must conduct a ritual of some kind to [[Contracts|contractually]] [[Tethers|connect]] with some other source of power. Then like all workers of Meyda their [[Nephesh (5e)]] may process the Meyda which they inform. Many Meyda-workers in training are confused at first by this concept, they find they are drawing from a near infinite well of power, but are incapable of drawing from it for more than a few paltry tricks. If not under the aegis of a wiser master a young Meyda-worker may tear their own soul to shreds leaving behind a [[Tzedef]]. A barely sapient shell devoid of intelligence or personality. 
Wizards are rare due to the dangerous and precise nature of their craft. It often takes years to understand the shape of ones soul to an acceptable level, depending on the master, and even then a knowledgeable Meyda-worker may still be a fool, thinking to overwork the Meyda one too many times and lose themselves entirely. In addition it requires an extensive knowledge of language, and substantial rote memorization of spells and the forms of Meyda-circles. Tens of thousands of hours are spent training, drawing, writing, reciting, and meditating before one is considered a competent mage.
Wizards differ from other non-Meyda-born in that they inform Meyda and conduct magic via memorization. Almost all other's draw from a source of Meyda which is also a mind. Pure or corrupt the mind which they have tied themselves to grants them knowledge of spell craft and provides access to both Meyda and knowledge.
# Common Sources of Meyda
- Wizards of the University in [[Zyclest City]] who graduate with exceptional marks earn the right to **connect** to the Universities [[God Stone]]. 
- The Elvish [[Nabalan]] connect to the heart of the [[Ambar Tree]], however if their soul is severed from the tree they are cutoff on all fronts.
- Rarely an individual mage may find themselves in possession of a [[God Stone]].
- There are some cases in which Wizards have worked their way into contracts with [[Dragons]] or other mages in which they connect to an unknown source of Meyda that is not also a [[Nephesh (5e)]]. Putting them adjacent to Warlocks #temp yet entirely separate.
