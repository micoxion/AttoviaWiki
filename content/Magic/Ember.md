The spark of unique life, the origin of consciousness, an ember is an extremely powerful primordial element the creation of which is largely unknown. Without the process of child bearing an Ember is the only known way in the Universe to create a truly intelligent consciousness. Many types of false consciousnesses can be made equivalent to a kind of artificial intelligence, however they are still rudimentary compared to the real thing. Embers are used by many [[Abbaki]] to create life on hospitable planets and are the catalysts for [[World Stone|World Stones]]. They then function as the final [[Ogen]] for the sentient races present on the planet, allowing their consciousnesses to live on in the World Stone indefinitely.
