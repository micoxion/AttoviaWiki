The [[Quill Masters]] is one of an esoteric, morally gray sect of wizards. Having a deep understanding of the power of contracts, the Quill Masters are often found spread throughout the realm as advisors, important officials, or assistants to the heads of organized crime. Everyone knows having a [[Quill]] around is useful, they can create concrete contracts, and ensure you aren't being entrapped in confusing clauses of another.

# Details
To become a member of the Quill Masters one must be accepted as a pupil of a Quill. Each Quill may only have one apprentice at any given time. One becomes an official Quill once they have contractually entrapped a sentient being within their spellbook. Preferably this being is demonic in nature, however some Quill's will allow their last apprentice to entrap them, providing a kind of immortality in servitude to their pupil. Other students have made notable contracts with creatures of the fey, and even some demi-gods.
When an apprentice graduates to a Quill they take on a new name, Quill followed by a short one or two syllable construct from their old name. This symbolizes their being written anew by the Quill, and the parts of them that remain.
