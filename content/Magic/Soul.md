The soul is a product only possible through the power of an [[Ember]]. Constructed of [[Meyda]] each soul is unique. A soulâ€™s structure is the reason it cannot be destroyed by simply being absorbed into another source of Meyda. They can of course disintegrate if made to process excessive Meyda, or if they are pulled apart by a significantly more powerful source.
# Soul Memory
Each new Soul is formed in part by another. As the DNA of a mother and father combine to make a new being, so does the Meyda of their Souls. It is not half and half, but just a spark from each. But that is enough to carry a deep, unknown memory through hundreds upon hundreds of generations. In the rare cases that these memories are [[Blood Dragons|revealed]] it is often fragmented, making little sense to anyone who does not know their own most ancient history. In the rare esoteric creation of the [[Awakened]] a piece of ones Soul must be incorporated to create a new Soul which may live its own life. Awakened Goblins, Trolls, Cats, and other creatures reflect their immediate creator in their Soul Memory as this is their lineage.
