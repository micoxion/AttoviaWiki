There are many workers of [[Meyda]] on Attovia. For there are many ways it can be done. The Wizards and Mages of learning, recording precise spell-work in their strange books. The witches and herbalists summoning up the heal and hurt of Meyda through their recipes and chants. The Meyda-blessed sorcerers born of its power, summoning it forth with practiced hands. The strange [[Fractalmancy|Fractal-mages]] of deep understanding and their Meyda-working tools which weave the world to their way. The [[Carven]], practitioners of precise self mutilation, deadly workers of the Meyda who few live to know. The elves work the Meyda of the Ambar tree, fueling their ancient lifetimes and granting their mages power unmatched. The [[Rugadh Sliabh]] work the forge-Meyda, their heated steel and hot iron breathing life into the old runes.

There also lies Meyda-work in the divine magics. [[Sundered Priests]] of [[Hormus]] wield great power in their pain. [[Moon-touched]] [[Dragonborn]] blessed with pure and corrupt power work Meyda to the whims of their Dragon gods. Elsewhere druids work the Meyda as the greater and lesser forests please, keeping their power in their purity.
