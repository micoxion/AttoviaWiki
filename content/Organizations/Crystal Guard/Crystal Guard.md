An ancient organization responsible for the birth of the [Zyclester Empire](Zyclester%20Empire.md) and generally involved in the politics of most nations. Origins dating back several thousand years, the Crystal Guard's higher ups hold secrets few mortals of Attovia are privy to. They are also the masterminds behind the forming of several larger mercenary groups like the [[Silver Swords]] who helped drive back the second wave of monster hordes to the [[Grask Forest]]. Currently they are at war with [[Meridas Malkom]] who seeks to free a Demon Lord to serve him and his desire to become a god. 
# Origins
When the 7 demon lords began to wreak havoc across the continent, 7 wizards of great power began to seek a way to permanently chain them. They find and obtain the 7 Great [[God Stone|God Stones]] which formed when Hormus was sundered. Several decades later after much study and experimentation the 7 wizards had created a spell capable of utilizing the Great God Stone to capture and bind a demon lord for 10,000 years. After the 7th demon lord was caged the wizards quickly set to work creating an organization that would be responsible for preparing the world for the demon lords return. This organization though at first nameless, became known as the Crystal Guard to those lucky or unlucky enough to know of their existence.
