The most depicted and written of, the Blood Dragons are the staple dragon imagined by anyone pondering the creatures. They have great crimson shield like scales which overlap roughly 30% of each other. The huge scales are steadily used as magical real-estate by Blood Dragons as they grow, ancient grown adults being covered in claw hewn [[Meyda-Circle|Meyda-circles]] which they use to cast powerful spells rapidly. A massive set of primary flight wings, and a smaller set of pilot wings located just above the tail which they use for precise steering and aerial control. A cartilaginous tail roughly 2/3rds as long as the body capable of being flattened out tapers sharply to a point.
Known for their historically violent tendencies, and ancient blood bathes, they have been so named Blood Dragons for their color and reputations. Just like all [[Dragons]] Blood Dragons are obsessed with maintaining the freedom of their [[Soul]]. Inscribing and experimenting with countless spells and Meyda-Circles with which to create a new [[Ogen]] or bind to another being's. This causes creature's in the vicinity to often experience strange hallucinations in relation to their Soul's memory, as the ancient creature's Meyda reaches out and tugs at any Ogens or Souls it can find, in a desperate attempt to save itself from a bitter void.
