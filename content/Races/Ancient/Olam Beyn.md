# Description
Known to most sentient creatures as gods or deities, the Olam Beyn are those beings who's [[Meyda]] formed Consciousness is so dense and powerful that it functions as its own [[Ogen]]. This means that they are capable of traversing between [[Luumara]] and [[L'vad]] at will. They are commonly powerful enough to conduct [[Contracts|Forced Contracts]] on most non-Olam Beyn, and can utilize extremely powerful [[âœ¨Magic]] with ease. 
# Origins
Most Olam Beyn are created by [[Abbaki]] who hold an [[Ember]]. However once an [[Abbaki]] has joined their ember and their body to a planet's [[World Stone]] Olam Beyn can come to exist due to powerful concepts and mass conscious belief. [[Mammon]] is an [[Attovia|Attovian]] example of this phenomenon. In even more rare occasions a sentient being that is otherwise not an Olam Beyn may rise to become one through a powerful contract or gift. [[Mordechai]] conducted such a contract.
