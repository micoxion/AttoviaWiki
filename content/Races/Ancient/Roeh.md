# Overview
Before [[The Great Conflict]] truly began Hormus took from his own stony flesh and created the Roeh alongside the [[Human|Humans]] and [[Elves]]. When each new sentient race was created by his hand a Roeh would join them in their respective home. The Roeh are a slow and graceful race. Each is granted Hormus' wisdom but a free mind and [[Soul]], with these aspects they guide their flock. Today most Roeh have joined Hormus in the Attovian soil. Becoming one with the planet as their progenitor before them generally ascending to become [[Olam Beyn]]. However, those who still believe their charge carries on remain as living, breathing deities who yet walk among their people. The only two known living Roeh continue to assist the Goliath #placeholder and [[TrÃ©igtheoir Sliabh]] of [[Strana Gigantov]], its frozen tundra and beset coast keeping the ever responsible Roeh from passing onward to true godhood.
# Description
Towering over the other sentient races the Roeh vary in height from one another usually anywhere from twenty to sixty feet. This often seems to depend largely on habitat and potential need for mobility or reach. Their skin usually mimics several types of minerals joined by clinging mosses and lichen. Some of the largest Roeh were said to host small colonies of birds or rodents, as well as complimentary foliage to the area. 
The Roeh's most notable features however, where their eyes. Massive infinite pools of swimming light that left any creature who gazed into them awestruck and mesmerized. Roeh were said to cast their magic without voice or motion instead simply turning an eye on a creature, friend or foe, and malady or cure would rush to it unfettered. 
# Details
Roeh eyes were made of a unique substance. Meyda in a jelly like state, not solid like a [[God Stone]] but not ephemeral like its natural form. This substance when connected to a Soul is capable of mirroring the soul's intention. Effectively, a dynamic [[Meyda-Circle]] with near instantaneous feedback. Though rarely (if ever) used to their full potential Roeh's eyes were easily capable of leveling mountains if the need arose.
