Massive lizard like beings who vary in appearance, from the komodo like Black Dragon to the majestic Red. Each begins its life as an egg about the size of a [[Human]] child.
# Details
Dragons are ancient corrupted lizards [[Construction of Dragons|built]] by [[Graskoroth]]. They are not truly sentient beings, but they are also not [[Demons]] having separated their minds from their original master's they are known as [[Mach'shavah Chofesh]]. They can think and grow for themselves, but they can never sever the strong [[Tethers|tether]] between themselves and Graskoroth. If they were to lose their [[Ogen]] their consciousness would immediately be reabsorbed by Graskoroth's mind and they would functionally cease to exist. It is for this reason that Dragons horde. Their false sentience is insecure, and they will find and use anything they can to ensure they remain alive and free for as long as possible.

# Types
### Blood Dragons
The most depicted and written of, the Blood Dragons are the staple dragon imagined by anyone pondering the creatures. They have great crimson shield like scales which overlap roughly 30% of each other. The huge scales are steadily used as magical realestate by Red Dragons as they grow, ancient grown adults being covered in claw hewn Meyda-Circle's which they use to cast powerful spells rapidly. A massive set of primary flight wings, and a smaller set of pilot wings located just above the tail which they use for precise steering and aerial control. A cartilaginous tail roughly 2/3rds as long as the body capable of being flattened out tapers sharply to a point.
### Green Dragons
Green dragons are deceptively powerful. They rarely spend time in their true form, often altering their form to facilitate their current scheme. Their true forms are rather small when it comes to dragons, they stand about 9-12 feet tall, walking on their short hind legs, and often dressing in lavish clothing. They are wingless, but have little need for natural wings when they can simply change shape into large birds of prey.
### Black Dragon
Black dragons are massive crosses between alligators and lizards, walking low to the ground, with rounded reptilian snouts. Their bacteria filled mouths corrode anything bitten or chewed with acidic compounds.
