Demon is a term thrown around for many malevolent beings with great power. Demon's more correctly are entities that reflect direct dark aspects of a higher deity. Demon's therefore produce the fa√ßade of sentience but cannot truly claim it. They are but a complex echo of an enormous mind. In general true demons are quite rare, requiring a higher being  of significant power to reflect. In fact many creatures labeled as such are corrupted creations or spawn of demons themselves, easily mistaken due to their similarly reflective nature.
# Appearance
Due to their source of progeny demons take extremely varying forms. [[The Hebdomad]] all displaying very unique appearances each reminiscent of the individual aspect of [[Graskoroth]] they spawned from.
