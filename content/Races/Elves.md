Paragons of beauty and pride, elves live extremely long lives. Often a bit stuck up, they have a bad habit of taking their lands standards for granted.

# Traits
Elves have a split mind, meaning they are capable of parallel processing. They do not sleep, the same way normal races do, instead they rest one side of their brain at a time allowing them to stay alert at all times.
