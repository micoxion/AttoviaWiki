At first one might believe that anything capable of living in the frozen waists of [[Strana Gigantov]] must have come from [[Sheol]] or be born of [[Graskoroth]]'s hatred. But the Snezhnyye Lyudi or Yewdi as they are commonly called are a peaceful race who call one of the [[Roeh|Great Shepherds]] their god and creator. They live a relatively structured tribal lifestyle that focuses heavily on community vs. the elements. 
# Appearance
Yewdi all share a few distinct features that remain largely unchanging except when [[Tieflings|Tiefling]] mutations are present. Coarse white fur covers most of their body except for the palms, soles of feet, and the front of the face. Bushy eyebrows and a long single braid of a beard frame the only visible pale flesh. Large eyes with more pupil than white which change color slightly depending on the season[^2]. Above the head, long rigid hairs sprout from the tips of the ears and reach a foot or two above the scalp. 
# Unique Features
Yewdi's stiff ear hairs allow them to detect changes in barometric pressure, giving them the ability to sense changes in the weather. 
In conjunction with eyes that allow them to see in the dim light of winter, and their Serdtse Ochag an organ that produces a remarkable amount of heat allowing for homeostasis at very low temperatures, they are highly specialized for the turbulent frozen lands of Strana Gigantov.
They often struggle to work [[Meyda]] in the same way most other creatures do, but have generationally passed down [[Meyda-Circle|Meyda-circles]] all with either utilitarian or religious purposes.

[^2]: Yewdi have a Tapedum lucidum that undergoes seasonal change like deer, to reflect different wavelengths of light depending on the amount available.
