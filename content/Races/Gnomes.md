Gnomes have a long history of oppression. Long since relegated to the now [[Shen Dynasty]], they almost all have a common heritage: Baking. After a malicious [[Shen Dynasty Rise to Power|deal]] made by the **Fu** clan with the [[Ashari|Ashari Theocracy]] they now rule the baking industry in most countries. Gnomes are a very short but industrious people, with generally sharp facial features and subtly pointed ears they are sometimes referred to as Drim, a derogatory term from a chopped version of the word Elves in elvish.
