Ratzach is a towering [[Blood Dragons|Blood Dragon]]. He is the first born of the original Blood Dragon [[Orgi Aima]]. He has lived for over five thousand years. From head to tail his scales are covered in etched magic circles. When he casts a spell one of these will glow brightly as he uses it to inform his [[Meyda]]. Ratzach is skeptical of the mortal races, but wise enough to know they are not all like the wizards of the [[Crystal Guard]] who hunted him and his kind for millennia. Ratzach, like all [[Dragons]] is terrified of death. Upon passing his Meyda will return to the mind of [[Graskoroth]] and his existence, his very essence will be erased. Ratzach cares little for any races but his own, and has a rare compassion for his own kind.
