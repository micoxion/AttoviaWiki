Bolin Fan is a bachelor fisherman turned entrepreneur. After becoming exhausted with the routine of fishing and its fickle paycheck he realized there was a market for centralizing the trade. So Bolin started the Bolin Fan Fishery which provided contracts that payed consistently in return for handling sales and distribution. It took him seven years to save up the required overhead, but twenty years later he has all but cornered the market. Not only the local area but many of the more northern territories import his fish. Roughly 30% of all fishing in the Frihet Lake is done by Bolin Fan Fishery Contractors.
