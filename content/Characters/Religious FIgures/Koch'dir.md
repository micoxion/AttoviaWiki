The 30th [[Divine Star]] and founder of sovereign [[Claskarian Theocracy|Claskaria]]. During his reign Koch'dir was quite controversial for his perceived heavy handed attempts at organization and structure. Something many [[Kochavism|Kochavists]] find antithetical to their belief system. Now more than 30 Divine Star's removed he is viewed highly by all but the sourest members of Kochavism as one who worked the great machinations of law and order to carve out further freedom from other would be oppressors.
