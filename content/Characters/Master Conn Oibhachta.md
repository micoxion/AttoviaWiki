# The Oibhachta's Index
Master Conn Oibhachta uses a alphanumeric system to designate and sort the IDs of his many cubicles. The [[Rugadh Sliabh]] use a base 16 number system, so each letter has 16 cubicles it is assigned to before moving to the next. Once the entire alphabet has been used up it restarts being tacked onto the last letter.
