# Weekdays
### Ambarday
Taken from the elves old calendar Ambar day is the current widely accepted first day of the week. Each year starts exactly on an Ambarday. Except every 10 years in which (last day of the week) occurs twice in a row to account for a noticeable offset.
### Slevday
Commonly thought to have originated from the [[Rugadh Sliabh]] named after their god [[Aoire Sléibhe]], and slowly mutated over time after being adopted by the Asharin calendar. 
### Atonday
Also referred to as the day of weakness, this week gets its unfortunate name from [[The Hebdomad]], specifically Atonía Lord of Weakness. 
### Tovday
Referring to the planets own name, ancient superstition about offsetting the bad luck of Atonday has seeped into the general culture of the continent and thus tovday is a common day for festivals and parties.
### Uhrataday
Named after the first ever [[The Head Priest|Head Priest]] of the Church of Hormus Uhrata Kaikki.
### Kragday
Named after [[Deities/Krag the Quick|Krag the Quick]].
### Mosday
Long since shortened from the previous Hormusday, Mosday is the seventh and last day of an Asharin week.
