# History of Attovia
A continent that until recently knew nothing but strife and darkness for many millennia. [[The Great Conflict]] left a populace forever at war with the sea. Floods of horrific [[True Monsters|Monsters]] clambered out of the sea foam, through the halls of the [[Goweh]], and spread calamity to every people. The rise and dominance of [[The Hebdomad]] still leaves its vestigial corruption in many who walk the continent.

After a major collapse in civilization it was in large thanks to the rapid progression of Meyda-work and magical research by which society rebounded, binding The Hebdomad, and rebuffing Graskoroth's grotesque hordes to the Grask Forest and Attovia's coasts. Finally, society itself began to play catchup, city states and organized religion rose steadily out of a culture of destructive progress.

With the eventual development of proper politics came the advent of proper war. With the lessons of the [[Era’s of Attovia#Times of Sorrow|Times of Sorrow]] but mere mythology, the sentient takes up arms against his own kind for pride, land, religion and wealth, and the [[Era’s of Attovia#Age of Nations|Age of Nations]] begins its turbulent cycle. In its almost three thousand years of history countless nations and city states rise and fall at the whims of mortal thought. Religious structures gain substantial momentum as the [[Contracts]] made with deities provide a boon to the military minded. Many such power dynamics remain to this very day, the Zoher theocracy the most old and notable.
### The Magic War
As the seesaw of progress tilts back towards Meyda-work, the Age of Nations culminates in the aptly named Magic War. The casualties accrued by almost every country exceeded the total recorded casualties of all other wars during the AoN combined. Lasting a full decade the Magic War left the Attovian Continent forever changed. Entire peoples were all but wiped out, and the previously diverse borders consolidated heavily as winner and loser alike held allies close to lick their wounds.
### Time of Rest
The modern Era of Attovia where a four century long implicit peace rests gently over the land. A new, tense feeling of the inevitable has crept under the blanket however, it whispers in the ears of the [[Houses]] of Helva. Its forked tongue tickles the Ornsiire Emperor's cheek, and [[Zyclester Empire#The Table|The Table]] of the Zyclester Empire requires little encouragement. The spoils of war have never looked so tempting.
