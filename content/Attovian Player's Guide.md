# History of Attovia
A continent that until recently knew nothing but strife and darkness for many millennia. [[The Great Conflict]] left a populace forever at war with the sea. Floods of horrific [[True Monsters|Monsters]] clambered out of the sea foam, through the halls of the [[Goweh]], and spread calamity to every people. The rise and dominance of [[The Hebdomad]] still leaves its vestigial corruption in many who walk the continent.

After a major collapse in civilization it was in large thanks to the rapid progression of Meyda-work and magical research by which society rebounded, binding The Hebdomad, and rebuffing Graskoroth's grotesque hordes to the Grask Forest and Attovia's coasts. Finally, society itself began to play catchup, city states and organized religion rose steadily out of a culture of destructive progress.

With the eventual development of proper politics came the advent of proper war. With the lessons of the [[Era’s of Attovia#Times of Sorrow|Times of Sorrow]] but mere mythology, the sentient takes up arms against his own kind for pride, land, religion and wealth, and the [[Era’s of Attovia#Age of Nations|Age of Nations]] begins its turbulent cycle. In its almost three thousand years of history countless nations and city states rise and fall at the whims of mortal thought. Religious structures gain substantial momentum as the [[Contracts]] made with deities provide a boon to the military minded. Many such power dynamics remain to this very day, the Zoher theocracy the most old and notable.
### The Magic War
As the seesaw of progress tilts back towards Meyda-work, the Age of Nations culminates in the aptly named Magic War. The casualties accrued by almost every country exceeded the total recorded casualties of all other wars during the Age of Nations combined. Lasting a full decade the Magic War left the Attovian Continent forever changed. Entire peoples were all but wiped out, and the previously diverse borders consolidated heavily as winner and loser alike held allies close to lick their wounds.
### Time of Rest
The modern Era of Attovia where a four century long implicit peace rests gently over the land. A new, tense feeling of the inevitable has crept under the blanket however, it whispers in the ears of the [[Houses]] of Helva. Its forked tongue tickles the Ornsiire Emperor's cheek, and [[Zyclester Empire#The Table|The Table]] of the Zyclester Empire requires little encouragement. The spoils of war have never looked so tempting.
# Meyda-work
A wizard's grand display of destructive force differs from the simple herbalists water purification in little but its complexity. Both are Meyda-workers instructing the strange [[Meyda|substance]] to work changes in the world around them. 

Whether it is via the precision of a [[Meyda-circle]] or through [[Meyda Intercession]] Attovian magic cannot function without a source of power. For commonplace Meyda-circles this is facilitated through the consumption of [[Chips]], Attovia's primary currency. In other instances it is the [[Tethers]] formed via [[Contracts]] with entities much more powerful than one's self that provide a flow of Meyda.

For more than eight thousand years Meyda-work was a tool of the gods, those they inspired, and the intellectual savant. However, the past several millennia have seen many jumps in understanding, leading to the generalization of what was once mere legend. Now during the tense Time of Rest Meyda-work can be seen in diverse forms in even the most remote hamlets.
# Sovereign Lands and Distant Homes
Across the Attovian Continent an eclectic people make their habitats in many varying cultures and environments. Here you will find a quick synopsis of each of the many nations that call Attovia home.
### [[Zoher]]
The oldest nation on Attovia by far if one counts out the tribal societies of Strana Gigantov and the Giravian Archipelago. Run by [[The Head Priest]] of the [[Church of Hormus]] and dedicated to their [[Hormus|deity]] the strange and compelling practices of sacrifice can be seen everywhere. [[Sundered Priests]] can be found in every city, their irreparably damaged bodies a miracle of divine rituals. 

The very nature of its leader makes Zoher one of the least corruptible systems of government on the continent. Instead Zoher's corruption hides in the smiles of the dejected [[Natush]] and wealthy aristocrats.
### [[Shen Dynasty]]
The once long oppressed Gnomes make their home in a portion of the frigid north granted them by Zoher a thousand years ago. Four families actively clash in an internal war of politics and backstabbing.  The wise and peaceful **Chao**, the near extinct **Wei**, an angry and dangerous **Fu**, and that family who's moniker adorns the nation itself: **Shen**. 

A strange history of [[Shen Dynasty Rise to Power|political maneuvers]] placed the **Shen** clan in power and simultaneously built the nation into a baking powerhouse. The Shen Dynasty has a viselike grip on the industry of baking, having trained and released their best into the continent who have little formally trained competition. 

Any settlement in the landlocked nations of Attovia with a population in the hundreds or more likely has a bakery, and the odds are 10 to 1 that its run and operated by Gnomes.
### [[Zyclester Empire]]
Forged in the Magic War, the Zyclester Empire is a nation of technological prowess and progress. Run and operated by members of the Table; theoretically merit based positions spanning the spectrum of what a large government might need. The great [[Zyclest University]] in their capital [[Zyclest City]] continues to push the empire to the forefront of Meyda-work research and development.

Zyclestian streets are kept safe by the notoriously effective [[Chain Keepers]]. An extremely organized group of law keepers who use imbued chains to fight and subdue criminals with remarkable efficiency.
### [[Kingdom of Helva]]
An elected monarchy built by taking advantage of the confusion in the year following the [[The Magic War Ends|end of the Magic War]]. Diplomatic espionage and social engineering turned many city states and disgruntled cities into a single united nation. Their capital [[Waterhelm]], built after the countries inception reflects their focus on order and efficiency.
### [[Claskarian Theocracy|Claskaria]]
Claskaria takes up the primary area where the [[Dragonborn]] make landfall. Those who are not born naturally on the continent are sent by [[Hikari]] via an egg cast from [[Yähti]] at unimaginable speeds. A strange jungle of a freemarket exists under the pillowy thumb of the [[Kochavism|Kochavist]] religion; a strange belief system that prioritizes freedom above all else. 

Run by the [[Divine Star]], their Kochrêa and a rag tag group of assistants the government is extremely lax. As much of a dream this can be for the average citizen, it is a pot of unguarded gold to the cults and spurned aristocrats of Attovia. Peoples unwelcome or unhappy with societal law elsewhere can go relatively unpoliced and unpunished.
### [[Daurk Brionnaigh]]
Across the [[Twilight Desert]] near the southwestern most corner of Attovia stands a tall, proud mountain known to all as [[Darkmount]]. Here live the great craftsmen of the [[Rugadh Sliabh]], overseen by [[The Council of Elders]] the nation of Daurk Brionnaigh runs quite smoothly. Long since shunted from the belly of the rock they dwell on, their focus is the fulfillment of outside orders, exporting their unrivaled works in return for all manner of needs and luxuries. And though the [[Master Cruthman]] forges the first blade, it is the [[Béal Brionnaigh]] taught by the [[Scríobs|Scríob]] that belches forth the hundred replicas laid out per the contract signed. [[The Craft Mind]] under miles of rock is the last hand to touch each exported treasure.
### [[Ornsiire Empire]]
An empire forged from a single city state by the hand of [[Gnaeus Metellus]] through militarization and a heavy hand. This trend has continued through their growth and can be seen in their governing hierarchy, based around the number of troops a given lord can muster at any given time for their Visare. 

Their border with the [[Western Wastes]] has spawned the only two functional mercenary companies of the continent. The [[Silver Swords]] and the [[Mun Blades]]. Each companies history is unique, but their finalization speaks to the necessity they served protecting the eastern border of Ornsiire thousands of turns ago. Though opposed to each other structurally, the two share a general kinship and friendly rivalry, staying out of one another's way where possible, and taking no grudges when exchanged blows were met with proper payment.
### [[Beleg gúl]]
Half the eastern coast belongs to the [[Elves]]. They have named their territories Beleg gúl and have built a large buffer of control around the beacon of their nation. The [[Ambar Tree]], an unfathomably colossal living organism, stretches multiple miles into the sky, providing space for several layers of society to live within it, their height within the tree directly correlating to their class and social standing.

The brilliant gold of [[Ambar Flower|Ambar Flowers]] contrasts unfortunately with the muck and grime of the southern border many miles away. A battle line of slaves and half-bloods fight a never ending war with the spawn of [[Graskoroth]] who find their way north after making land. The beautiful [[Ambar Forest]] does not show its face here, where the blood, mud and gore have emulsified into a singular foul mass, the stench of which clears wildlife off for tens of miles.
### [[Giravian Archipelago]]
A strange, and unknown anomaly has made the waters surrounding the tiny islands of the [[Girav gel]] the only nautical safe haven the continent has ever seen. Even the most well guarded port town would pay a kings ransom for he security in which these large aquatic people make their culture. Little of their ritualistic tribal warfare is understood by outsiders, but the habitants of the Giravian Archipelago couldn't be happier. They live a strange and simple, but arguably beautiful life here, and seek not the luxuries of other nations.
### [[Strana Gigantov]]
The ice and wind of this northern territory is so constant and disruptive, that the number of non-natives who find their way behind its borders can be counted on one hand in a given turn. For this reason the culture and habits of the [[Yewdi]] and [[Tréigtheoir Sliabh]] are unfamiliar to the masses. Even in Attovia's age of progression information regarding Strana Gigantov remains an untenable mixture of legend and historical truth.
# Denizens of Attovia
A rich and often traumatic history adorns each of Attovia's racial and ethnic groups. Many such histories overlap, the oppressed and their oppressors telling and recording differing historical accounts. Each people paints their hue of truth on the canvas of time, and where their colors differ, the lines turn a muddy brown.
### [[Human]]
According to the Zoherians and the Elves the Humans were [[Hormus|Hormus']] first created sentient people. In general there is some deep cultural pride due to this mythology. For better they strive to become great individuals, and for worse they lord it over others. 

Among the Human species as it were there are four distinct genetic groups. Because the mortal mind is most pleased when it can categorize by the most obvious differences, each of these groups has its own cultural background and societal norms. There is little to no strife between the four but like keeps to like and thus they drew tribal lines thousands of turns ago that remain to this day.
##### Amodians
Rusty red skin and broad stature set the Amodians apart from not only other Humans, but from most other races except those touched by Tiefling corruption. In the ancient past Amodians drew the unwanted eye of [[Corruption Cleansers]] due to their skin easily mistaken for demonic mutation. Now such mistakes are extremely rare, and in fact have reversed; consistently pigment altered Tieflings with no other obvious signs being taken incorrectly for Amodians.
##### Nammalians
Nammalians are *notably* smaller than the other three groups. Despite their remarkable departure in stature their proportions have remained surprisingly intact. As though a full sized Zoherian were shrunk down exactingly. Nammalians less notably differ from their brethren in the general variety in their skin tone, from a Zoherian pale to an almost Tzelian tan they cover a broader spectrum than any other Human.
##### Zoherians
Of any Human sub-group the Zoherians are the most proud. It is only their name which decorates the oldest nation, and within said nation the greatest religion. Their pale skin evokes a transparency their ego is all to eager to mimic. Most of the [[Church of Hormus]] consists of Zoherian priests, but no individual is ever refused from service for any reason other than lacking the life of sacrificed to be expected from one of The Bereaved.
##### Tzelians
The Tzelians are often considered the wisest of the Humans. Just as any Zoherian may show humility a Tzelian may show themself a fool, but as generalizations go history has played favorites to the idea of the Tzelian wiseman. Many of the greatest Human breakthroughs in [[Meyda-work]], Philosophy, and religion are attributed to great Tzelian men and women. No other species has a complexion that can compare to the deep ebony of the Tzelian and they can be found *everywhere*. They have spread through the continent more so than any other Human and are appreciated wherever they find homes.
### [[Elves]]
The Elves scoff at the pride of Humans. After all, they are the perfected form spawned by the imperfect, short lived Human creature. They are the closest mortal beings to godhood and believe all others ought to understand this simple fact of nature. This idea of nature defining the order of authority and thus society can be seen permeating every corner of Elven society. Though a shining beacon of beauty from the outside, behind the doors of the upper class a grave campaign of pride and hate presses forward.

Many Elves of lower standing find themselves disgusted with the conduct of their nations aristocracy. It is this diaspora that has lead to the Elven and Half-elven individuals and groups found in all nations, even the most remote or obscure.
##### Half-Elves
Due to a surprising genetic closeness, Humans can have children with Elves. A strange blessing and curse it brings to the child at hand. It is a strange and terrible thing when one side of your heritage falls into the obscurity of a mind that has experienced many lifetimes. Half-Elves receive the same life expectancy as their elvish parent, and pull most of their appearance from their Human half. In addition Half-Elves are only capable of procreating with other Half-Elves for reasons still yet unknown.
### [[Rugadh Sliabh]]
Ashy grey skin, short yet muscular, great black beards that stretch to the center of the torso, and fingers which itch to pull form from rock and stone. The Rugadh are simple and easily read, anyone on the continent who has met a Rugadh would have intuited these aspects rather quickly. But within their honest simplicity a complex and ancient culture exists. For a Rugadhian heart to sing they must be part of a creation process. For the [[Master Cruthman]] it is most obvious, but for the Master [[Daurk Brionnaigh#Leabharchoimeád|Leabharchoimeád]] it is perhaps less so. No naming of Mastery has existed since the time of [[Rugadhian History#The Waking Floods|The Waking Floods]] that was not recognized by [[The Council of Elders]] to be, at its core, subservient to the art of creation granted the Rugadh by [[Aoire Sléibhe]].
##### [[Tréigtheoir Sliabh]]
A subset of Rugadhian's who split from [[Darkmount]] several thousand turns ago. Though scattered across Attovia, their primary home and source of culture is in [[Strana Gigantov]] alongside the [[Yewdi]] people. The drastic change in environment enforced a steady change in the Tréigtheoirians. Their complexion has become more of a light sandy brown, their body fat ratio has increased to counteract the harsh winters of the north, and every one to the last of them has a beard as white as the snow they call home.
