# History of Attovia
A continent that until recently knew nothing but strife and darkness for many millennia. [[The Great Conflict]] left a populace forever at war with the sea. Floods of horrific [[True Monsters|Monsters]] clambered out of the sea foam, through the halls of the [[Goweh]], and spread calamity to every people. The rise and dominance of [[The Hebdomad]] still leaves its vestigial corruption in many who walk the continent.

After a major collapse in civilization it was in large thanks to the rapid progression of Meyda-work and magical research by which society rebounded, binding The Hebdomad, and rebuffing Graskoroth's grotesque hordes to the Grask Forest and Attovia's coasts. Finally, society itself began to play catchup, city states and organized religion rose steadily out of a culture of destructive progress.

With the eventual development of proper politics came the advent of proper war. With the lessons of the [[Era’s of Attovia#Times of Sorrow|Times of Sorrow]] but mere mythology, the sentient takes up arms against his own kind for pride, land, religion and wealth, and the [[Era’s of Attovia#Age of Nations|Age of Nations]] begins its turbulent cycle. In its almost three thousand years of history countless nations and city states rise and fall at the whims of mortal thought. Religious structures gain substantial momentum as the [[Contracts]] made with deities provide a boon to the military minded. Many such power dynamics remain to this very day, the Zoher theocracy the most old and notable.
### The Magic War
As the seesaw of progress tilts back towards Meyda-work, the Age of Nations culminates in the aptly named Magic War. The casualties accrued by almost every country exceeded the total recorded casualties of all other wars during the Age of Nations combined. Lasting a full decade the Magic War left the Attovian Continent forever changed. Entire peoples were all but wiped out, and the previously diverse borders consolidated heavily as winner and loser alike held allies close to lick their wounds.
### Time of Rest
The modern Era of Attovia where a four century long implicit peace rests gently over the land. A new, tense feeling of the inevitable has crept under the blanket however, it whispers in the ears of the [[Houses]] of Helva. Its forked tongue tickles the Ornsiire Emperor's cheek, and [[Zyclester Empire#The Table|The Table]] of the Zyclester Empire requires little encouragement. The spoils of war have never looked so tempting.
# Meyda-work
A wizard's grand display of destructive force differs from the simple herbalists water purification in little but its complexity. Both are Meyda-workers instructing the strange [[Meyda|substance]] to work changes in the world around them. 

Whether it is via the precision of a [[Meyda-circle]] or through [[Meyda Intercession]] Attovian magic cannot function without a source of power. For commonplace Meyda-circles this is facilitated through the consumption of [[Chips]], Attovia's primary currency. In other instances it is the [[Tethers]] formed via [[Contracts]] with entities much more powerful than one's self that provide a flow of Meyda.

For more than eight thousand years Meyda-work was a tool of the gods, those they inspired, and the intellectual savant. However, the past several millennia have seen many jumps in understanding, leading to the generalization of what was once mere legend. Now during the tense Time of Rest Meyda-work can be seen in diverse forms in even the most remote hamlets.
# Sovereign Lands and Distant Homes
Across the Attovian Continent an eclectic people make their habitats in many varying cultures and environments. Here you will find a quick synopsis of each of the many nations that call Attovia home.
### [[Zoher]]
The oldest nation on Attovia by far if one counts out the tribal societies of Strana Gigantov and the Giravian Archipelago. Run by [[The Head Priest]] of the [[Church of Hormus]] and dedicated to their [[Hormus|deity]] the strange and compelling practices of sacrifice can be seen everywhere. [[Sundered Priests]] can be found in every city, their irreparably damaged bodies a miracle of divine rituals. 

The very nature of its leader makes Zoher one of the least corruptible systems of government on the continent. Instead Zoher's corruption hides in the smiles of the dejected [[Natush]] and wealthy aristocrats.
### [[Shen Dynasty]]
The once long oppressed Gnomes make their home in a portion of the frigid north granted them by Zoher a thousand years ago. Four families actively clash in an internal war of politics and backstabbing.  The wise and peaceful **Chao**, the near extinct **Wei**, an angry and dangerous **Fu**, and that family who's moniker adorns the nation itself: **Shen**. 

A strange history of [[Shen Dynasty Rise to Power|political maneuvers]] placed the **Shen** clan in power and simultaneously built the nation into a baking powerhouse. The Shen Dynasty has a viselike grip on the industry of baking, having trained and released their best into the continent who have little formally trained competition. 

Any settlement in the landlocked nations of Attovia with a population in the hundreds or more likely has a bakery, and the odds are 10 to 1 that its run and operated by Gnomes.
### [[Zyclester Empire]]
Forged in the Magic War, the Zyclester Empire is a nation of technological prowess and progress. Run and operated by members of the Table; theoretically merit based positions spanning the spectrum of what a large government might need. The great [[Zyclest University]] in their capital [[Zyclest City]] continues to push the empire to the forefront of Meyda-work research and development.

Zyclestian streets are kept safe by the notoriously effective [[Chain Keepers]]. An extremely organized group of law keepers who use imbued chains to fight and subdue criminals with remarkable efficiency.
### [[Kingdom of Helva]]
An elected monarchy built by taking advantage of the confusion in the year following the [[The Magic War Ends|end of the Magic War]]. Diplomatic espionage and social engineering turned many city states and disgruntled cities into a single united nation. Their capital [[Waterhelm]], built after the countries inception reflects their focus on order and efficiency.
