### Details
The House of Affairs is at present run via the influential family Woodsoul. Nepotistic tendencies is relatively normal in Helva and its Houses, but none quite so prolific as House of Affairs. Few members even at the lowest rungs are hired from anywhere but within the bloodline. This is argued as beneficial due to its encapsulated nature since the subject matter of Affairs is to be kept hush hush at all times.
# The House of Letters
### Purpose
Facilitates the construction, staffing, and updating of a rudimentary education system. No universities exist in Helva yet, but their more broad literacy program has shown to be a massive boon in general populace well being, wealth, and happiness.
