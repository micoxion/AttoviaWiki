# [[The House of Commerce]][^1]
### Purpose
Encapsulates the large portion of a governing body's job to manage its budgets, collect taxes, and regulate civilian commerce. The House of Commerce most notable recent work was to setup a licensing system for merchants. Allowing them to submit their books for examination and purchase a license stating they are a House of Commerce Approved Merchant.

# [[The House of War]][^1]
### Purpose
All things militaristic are controlled and pushed by the House of War. Due to the formation of the nation being exclusively peaceful they lack personal context for the kind of militaristic force required to protect a nation. They have relied heavily on the House of Diplomats, and even more so the House of Affairs to keep them *out* of war entirely, as they continue to research and hire citizens of other countries in the hopes to build an adequate army.
# [[The House of Law]][^1]
### Purpose
Maintains the system of law keeping bodies. Specifically the codification of the [[Watchmen]] who patrol the streets of all Helvan cities whether civilian or government hired.
# [[The House of Diplomats]]
### Purpose
The first Council formed that was not one of the original three. The House of Diplomats invests the majority of their resources into maintaining contact and good graces with the other sovereign nations of Attovia. They are one of the only houses that has more than one Head of House and functions along a quasi-internal democracy. This is partially defined in their purpose, that the house should never be run by a singular individual since the decisions made directly impact foreign policy.
# [[The House of Judgement]]
### Purpose
The system of the Audit has become increasingly complex, and the House of Judgement's entire job is to conduct the research and investigation necessary to determine whether or not a new House should be accepted to the Council. In addition the House of Judgement keeps tabs on existing houses, ensuring their proposed Purposes are not falling by the wayside in the stead of political gain or personal pursuits.
# [[The House of Affairs]]
### Purpose
By far the most secretive house, the House of Affairs controls the dark corners of the government and nation. Keeping tabs on potentially disruptive parties, sabotaging assassination attempts, removing those who might harm the Kingdom of Helva, and often sending spies and agents to other nations to ensure they have large amounts of info on their comings and goings.
# [[The House of Letters]]
### Purpose
Facilitates the construction, staffing, and updating of a rudimentary education system. No universities exist in Helva yet, but their more broad literacy program has shown to be a massive boon in general populace well being, wealth, and happiness.
