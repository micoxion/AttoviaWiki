The most eclectic of the modern nations, the Kingdom of Helva hosts a staggeringly diverse population. Created after [[The Magic War]] through diplomatic espionage they are the first and only current kingdom with an elected monarch.

# Government
The kingdom of helva has at its head an elected monarch, selected by an elected council who are selected by the people. The king can declare martial law under times of duress, and may attempt to pass any laws he creates or is provided via the council or the people. A new law can only be passed if a 2/3rds majority vote is cast in its favor by the Council.
## Helvan Contract
The first founding document of any nation on Attovia. The Helvan Contract was signed by the first 3 Council Members and their King. It lays out the base structure of government and other important rules and concepts core to Helva.
## Period of Kingly Term
The King's term is unlimited, so long as he is alive and the Council deems him fit to rule he may rule. This does have the secondary unfortunate effect of encouraging assassination as a fast track to getting a new attempt at the throne.
## King
Raivo Woodsoul has served as the figure head of Helva for the last 23 years. He is now 59 years old and his human age is beginning to betray him.
## Period of Council Term
A Council member serves for seven years, before his House must elect a new representative.
## Council
The Helvan Contract dictates that any group who wishes to be represented on the Council may have one, and only one elected Council member. To have a representative a group must meet the following requirements.
- Submit a House Statement of Purpose that outlines why they believe their group should be represented, and how they might improve the nation through their representation. 
- After having their House Statement of Purpose approved they must elect a member of their group to be their representative within one week (this is to ensure that there is minimal infighting and a general cohesion within the group).
- The new member of the Council will serve for the standard Council Term before being Audited. If the Audit goes well and they are accepted officially the House will have a permanent seat on the Council unless it is removed by unanimous vote.
These groups once accepted are then officially considered a House of Helva.
Current council members and their houses can be seen below.

## Audit
The House of Helva Audit is an extremely thorough investigation into all doings of a future House of Helva during their Council member's first term. It is a House's responsibility to contribute to the government in such a way that aligns with their Statement of Purpose, and to have elected a Council member who accurately represents them. If any portion of this responsibility is found substantially lacking a vote may be called and upon 2/3rd's majority the House is rejected. A group may try any number of times to become a House simply requiring a new or rewritten Statement of Purpose to kick start the process again.

# Political Status

## Global
The Kingdom of Helva is known for its shrewd and forward thinking diplomatic movements and deals. They have negotiated lucrative trade with almost all of their neighboring nations, and have formed a web of powerful alliances that make them a dangerous target.

## Internal 
Political power means everything in Helva, it means wealth, a chance at the Council and even more so a chance to be King. Politicians make up over 90% of the upper class, and the game they play is cutthroat. Bribes, assassinations, coups, and betrayals are constant, each player doing what they can to gain power over others and maintain stature. 

## [[Zyclester Empire]]
Extremely valuable trade deals have smoothed over past drama. However as Helva's power grows relations fray.
