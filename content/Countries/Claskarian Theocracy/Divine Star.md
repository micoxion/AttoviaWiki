The Divine Star is the vessel through which [[Urumuri]] communicates to her people on the planet of Attovia. More specifically it is [[Kochavism|Kochavism's]] leader and believed direct line to her majesty the Great Platinum Dragon. To become a divine star one must meet all 4 of the following requirements within seven days:
- Sent directly from [[Urubu]] to Attovia's soil. No one born a natural birth could hope to have such a **[[Tethers|Tether]]** to Urumuri
- Deemed by a collected council of 17 peers to accurately represent the tenets of Kochavist freedom
- Accurately predict the time and location of the arrival of a new [[Dragonborn]]. Urumuri will send her chosen leader a companion, a Kochrêa who will assist them for the duration of their reign.
- Bear the mark of freedom. A bright star like birthmark (almost always) previously unknown will glow brightly during the selection cycle.
A Divine Star will rule for 30 years, promptly passing away along with their Kochrêa the moment their time is up. It is said their [[Soul|souls]], now more free than ever may frolic across the [[Luumara]] without care, and are welcomed into the embrace of their queen. The search will begin for a new leader, the initial hallmark being a bright, shining birthmark. The cycle can be short circuited in the case of an untimely death. In this case however, the cycle’s timeline still remains consistent, the new Divine Star will live only the remaining portion of the late leaders cycle and without a Kochrêa to assist them.
