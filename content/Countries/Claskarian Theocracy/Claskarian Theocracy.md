Grown from small but many communes and encampments the Claskarian Theocracy exploded in size through its charismatic leaders and extremely welcoming theology. To this day Claskaria has little structure within its populace, who lean heavily into the teachings of the nation. Communes, villages and towns dot the landscape wherever enough people come together. The capital is one of the only major cities that boasts more than a thousand residents.

# Government
Claskaria is always ruled by the [[Divine Star]]. Picked during a divine ritual every 30 years (or after an untimely death) the Divine Star helps facilitate law and order through his dragon priests, who work churches and chapels throughout the nation ensuring order and the teachings of [[Kochavism]] are kept intact. Overall the ruling body is extremely loose on the populace, impressing freedom above all else, and only enforcing law when it inhibits another's freedom. This does of course leave much room for peer to peer oppression to occur under the not-so-watchful eye of the simplistic governing body.
### Divine Star
Minoru is the current Divine Star, he is a blue dragonborn who has served as Divine star for 17 years. His Kochrêa is named Sora, and she is a pure white dragonborn of powerful sorcery. Under each Divine Star and Kochrêa the base hierarchy of governing systems is subject to change. The current system is simplistic but effective. 
Minoru spends the majority of his time walking the streets of the small capital Kochav, checking in on his residents and healing the sick and infirm. 
### Kochrêa
Sora runs the administrative aspect of the country, utilizing 4 attendants to feed her information about the countries comings and goings, as well as accepting and entertaining envoys from other nations. She has also revived a rudimentary mail system from the ruling Divine Star before last, which she uses to maintain contact between other major cities.
###### Attendants
- Ume, a female orangish bronze dragonborn who attempts to keep track of the countries hap hazard books.
	 Ume has always been one to bite off more than she can chew. Her sudden immersion in her current task of organizing her countries twisted and tangled books is by far the most daunting task she has ever faced. However, she does her duty with the utmost courage and congeniality letting very few know how truly terrified of failure she really is.
- Kaoru, a male green dragonborn who acts largely as a catch all assistant to Sora when she needs something organized or done.
	 Kaoru is very pragmatic, he seems to have some romantic interest in Sora, but ensures that his duties come before anything else. 
- Belanor Caiwynn is an older half-elf man who Sora turns to for council when she is doubtful, or in need of advice. 
	 Belanor also takes care of the more shady practices which the government must participate. Paying off cult leaders to keep them satiated and stable, ensuring the removal of would be assassins and transgressors to the Divine Star etc. Everyone in the government is aware of these things and their need, but few will address them head on the way Belanor can. 
- Tressle Sternwood is a young level headed halfling man who largely ensures that Sora knows where Minoru is at all times, and if/when he needs something.
	 Galivanting about with Minoru as he wanders to and fro across [[Kochav]] and on some occasions small swaths of Claskaria itself. He has grown quickly as a person since his joining Sora's attendants, in no small part to the teachings of the Divine Star who he admires deeply.

# Political Status
#### General
The majority of other nations and groups see Claskaria as a bit of a nuisance. The strange country sits on huge wells of untapped natural resources, but is extremely taxing to invade. They fortunately never feel like a threat since they are practically non-existent in the diplomatic field. This strange balance has kept them from any major conflicts and maintained their neutrality during [[The Magic War]] which largely unaffected them.
#### [[Zyclester Empire]]
Zyclest, still a young nation born from their victory in the magic war sees Claskaria as an unknown threat. They have several dozen spies and informants spread throughout Claskarian borders who constantly inform [[Zyclester Empire|The Table of Judges]] of the goings on within this strange disjointed place.
#### [[Shen Dynasty]]
The Shen Dynasty was somewhat apprehensive when they realized that Claskaria was uninterested in making any kind of deal in regards to baking exclusivity. However, when they sent several envoys to find spots to put down new bakeries, the warm welcome they received has helped to smooth things over. No contract means no hindrance when planting a new business, but it also ensures some level of competition. Thankfully, the gnomes trained at University had little competition, and relations remain positive.
