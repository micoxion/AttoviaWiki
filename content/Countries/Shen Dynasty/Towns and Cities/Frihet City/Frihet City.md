Frihet City is quite sizable, full of business and trade ferried across the Frihet lake along the Frihet and Zìyóu rivers towards [[Morus]] in [[Ashari|Ashari]], [[Twin Lakes]] in [[Zyclester Empire|Zyclest]], and [[Waterhelm]] in [[Kingdom of Helva|Helva]]. Overall an extremely mercantile city, it is one of the wealthiest places in all of the Shen Dynasty. Despite its commerce related success the locals of Frihet City remain surprisingly dour. Not even two decades ago the capital of the [[Shen Dynasty]] was officially changed by the **Shen** family from Frihet City to Vulkud, ripping an important piece of pride from the financially powerful city. This left a hole in the heart of the people of the city that continues to persist to this day. [[Gnomes]] are prone to keeping grudges thanks to their dark history and the people of Frihet City display this behavior to the fullest.

# Sub-prefectures
Frihet city is broken up into 6 sub-prefectures, each hosting a guard house and detail lead by a Head Officer. 
## Great Docks
A large span of docks on the western side of the lack just beneath the mouth of the [[Jianbo River]].
A number of successful businesses have warehouses or headquarters here. Such real-estate is highly coveted and makes for much of internal political drama.
- [[Bolin Fan Fishery]]
- [[Master Conn Oibhachta's Residence]]
- [[Chi Kee Sawmill and Lumber]]
- [[Great Docks Guardhouse]]
## East Docks
Several more scattered docks on the north shore of [[Frihet Lake]]. Smaller and more sparse than the Great Docks but still host many ships, some simply waiting for a spot at the Great Docks to open up.
## Old City
A large swath of land surrounding the [[Fu Clan Palace]], dedicated to servants, and extended relations.
- [[Frihet City Quill Master Office]]
- [[Library of Freedom]]
## Frihet Market
A mixture of businesses both mercantile and residential. Almost any traditional goods can be found here, including some more exotic items like [[Spider Silk]] textiles and imported potion materials. Some of the shops are listed below:
- [[Xueyan Potions]]
- [[Zin Wei's Clothier Services]]
- 
This sub-prefecture has grown the most over the cities life time and as it sprawls westerly it also hosts the [[Frihet City Silver Sword Chapter|Frihet City Silver Sword Chapter's]] buildings, residences, and several alters to different deities. 
- [[Frihet City CoH Alter|Alter]] to Hormus
- [[Frihet City Qiúfàn Nǚwáng Shrine|Small Shrine of Qiúfàn Nǚwáng]]
- [[Frihet City Shrine to Ukko]]
- [[Frihet City Shrine to Pellervo]]
## West Gate
Rows and rows of tightly packed houses, taverns and [[Xībao]] (bread lounges) that expand out from the western gate. Encompasses this largely residential area up until it collides with the Jianbo River and the Frihet Gate sub-prefecture. The close streets, alleys, and space near water with little docking makes for the perfect habitat of those seeking asylum from the law. Urchin pick pockets, grifters, fortune tellers, the flash of a thief's knife, and below it all: [[The Underground]].
- [[Wǎnshàng Xībao]]
- [[Mengyin Fu's Goods for the Discerning Eye]]
- [[Zhǎng kēng]]
## Frihet Gate
The smallest sub-prefecture, hemmed in by the tightly packed blocks of the West Gate, and the sprawling warehouses of the Great Docks. Frihet Gate is a bustling center of foreign trade bureaucracy. 
- [[Foreign Relations Center]]
- [[Fu Clan Prison]]
