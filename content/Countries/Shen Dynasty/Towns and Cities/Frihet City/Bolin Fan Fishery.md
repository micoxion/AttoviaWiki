The current largest fishing company in [[Frihet City]]. Run by [[Bolin Fan]] it has large control over the fishing market in the local area and much of the Shen Dynasty outside of Frihet City. They have a single large two story building with a wooden sign crafted by the [[Chi Kee Sawmill and Lumber]] company. The first story is where the general managerial work is done, fishermen sign and renew contracts, orders are finalized, and inventory reports are reviewed. The second story is Bolin Fan's living quarters, as well as a private personal office for more important discussions can be had.
