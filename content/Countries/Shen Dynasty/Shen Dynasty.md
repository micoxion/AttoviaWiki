# Description

The Shen Dynasty, or Shen as many are found to call it is a country in a constant state of private turmoil. Five great houses vie for control at all times; **Wei**, **Kai**, **Fu**, **Chao** and **Shen.** Outwardly Shen presents as whole, united against the [Gnomes](Gnomes.md) history of oppression. Boasting 7 trade schools dedicated to baking and cooking, Shen has monopolized the trade, allowing only citizens of the territory to attend. 

# Political Status

**Internal:** Currently in political control is the **Shen** family. However, financial power currently favors the **Wei** and **Fu** houses.

********************Zyclester:******************** The [Zyclester Empire](Zyclester%20Empire.md) has a contract with the Shen Dynasty obligating them to only employ gnome bakers. This has helped to smooth over some of the bad blood between the two countries due to a history of oppression.

**Ashari:** The Asharin Theocracy was the first country to make steps towards freeing gnomes. The land which makes up the Shen Dynasty was given to the gnomes in large from [[Ashari|Ashari's]] own borders.
# Notable Families
### Shen
The **Shen** family has maintained power as the ruling family after their initial [[Shen Dynasty Rise to Power|rise to power]]. It is a tenuous grasp in which their greed has begun to backfire, as their nation begins to steadily turn on them.
### Chao
A clan of good gnomes, the **Chao** family have never been in power since the country of the gnomes sovereignty. During the early years of organized gnome uncertainty the **Chao** clan was a beacon of leadership, character, and wisdom. For this reason **Chao** family members are respected by the other four clans, and are generally left out of disputes, both violent and diplomatic. Unfortunately the current gnomish climate requires a certain level of corruption, and backstabbery to get ahead so the **Chao** family remains peacekeeping sources of advice with little real power.
### Fu
The Fu family still fumes against he **Shen** clan after being toppled due to their arrogance. This anger was further ignited when **Shen** officially migrated the capital from [[Frihet City]] to [[Vulkud]], leaving the **Fu** home a shadow of its former self.
### Wei
Having all but died out after being chased from power by the **Fu** clan, the small remaining family members of **Wei** were driven north, granted as an insult, a few hamlets of land often beset and ruined by occasional monster incursion from the nearby coastline. 
### Kai
Steeped in strange gnomish mythology, the **Kai** family has no known residence. [[Goweh Gnome|Goweh Gnomes]], a guild of assassins, disjointed groups of vigilantes, many claims are made of the mysterious **Kai** clan, but it is naught but speculation by a curious populace regarding what many consider an urban myth.
> [!warning]- SPICY SPOILER
The **Kai** do exist though, away from the public eye they actively sell their service to each of the other four clans. Yes even the **Chao** utilize the unique skillset of the **Kai**. They have co-opted a set of [[Goweh]] tunnels which run underneath the majority of the tundra that makes up the [[Shen Dynasty]]. This allows them to traverse vast distances in complete secret, making them a capable recourse of espionage, assassination, and general information.
The **Kai** families plans and roots run much deeper than this however. Even their mystical existence within the Shen Dynasty is a front to a much deeper organization.
