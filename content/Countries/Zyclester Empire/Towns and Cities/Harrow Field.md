# Description

A sizeable town in the Zyclester Empire boasting roughly 5,000 residence. It is surrounded by a 10 foot wide stone wall with walkways for guards. The main road cutting through Harrowfield's center continues directly on to Zyclest City. Many roads shoot off to either side leading to residences, shops, inns, taverns, and a small marketplace.

# Buildings/Layout

### Shops

- Patties Iron Works
    
    A place to buy very durable well crafted weapons and armor.

    A small house on Harrowfield's market street out of which Esper a sweet halfling man and his adopted gnome son Eddy run their spices shop.

- Bakery

### Inns/Taverns

- Harrowing Inn
    
    A surprisingly cheery establishment run by a stout but friendly [[Rugadh Sliabh|Rugadhian]] named Hammond. He is single but makes his own ale and it is delicious. Hammond keeps the majority of riffraff out of his inn and it has plenty of atmosphere.
    
    Owned by Hammond
    
- Winking Beaver
    
    In the poorer side of town, this inn costs little to stay in but there is no guarantee you'll walk out with all your valuables.
