# Description

Capital city of the [[Zyclester Empire]]. A hub of magical study, knowledge, experimentation, and invention. The residents are all above the national average in wealth and quite snobbish. This city is extremely advanced, and is home to the College of Zyclest, the best school of magic in all of Attovia. The Table of Judges gathers in Zyclest City to reevaluate the decrees and laws made previously and suggest and vote on new ones. The city is laid out in 4 rough districts. The market district sprawls across the southern entrance to the city sweeping out and connecting to the poor district and the high district. The poor district is riddled with slums and inns, but not all who live there are so bad off. The high district is where those with the greatest income live. It boasts lavish dwellings and almost every house within this district is fueled by magic, drawing a stream of [[Meyda]] from the cities central [[God Stone]] housed within the University. The university itself doubles as both a school of magic and the meeting place for the Table. The university (a district all its own) is extremely well kept, hemmed by walls, and guarded by some of the [Chain Keepers](Chain%20Keepers.md)' best.

# Buildings

### Shops

- Christals!
    
    Small jewelry shop selling both magical and non-magical items to beautify.
    
    Owned by Chris, a friendly human man who enjoys the city life.
    
- Zyclest City Bakery
    
    Very large multi-entrance, multi-checkout bakery within the most residential area of Zyclest City. A plethora of gnomes and the occasional halfling run the establishment producing enough baked goods to fuel the city. Workers are tense and rushed and hurry customers along who are unsure or hesitant.
    
- Riggor’s Experimentals
    
    A small squat shop with billowing smoke coming out the top that occasionally changes colors.
    
    Functions as bot ha business and home for Riggor. A magic shop in which Riggor sells his experimental concoctions and inventions. He gets little business and survives off of grants from the university.
    
- Zyclest Honors Emporium
    
    A small but beautiful building emblazoned with the Zyclest University logo. Inside there are many glass cases hosting Zyclest Student honors projects. Each project is auctioned off over the course of several days.
    
    The Zyclest University Seniors who graduate with honors get their final projects displayed and put up for auction here. These are very unique experimental items which are often sold for a high price to help fund the University.
    
- Blacksmith shop
- The Weave
	A beautiful clothing boutique run by Ms. Donatella, a stout second generation goliath woman who is most often found in *almost* ball gowns. She takes commissions for 90 Chips to 3 bits depending on the clothing. But also sells a variety of accessories and premade clothing for quick fashion seekers.
- Crooks Nook
	A gruff but friendly halfling runs this very tiny book store squished between two large stone buildings. You might be surprised what you can find here.

### Temples/Shrines

- [[Church of Hormus]]
    
    This large beautiful [[CoH Temples|Temple]] is manned by 2 Eyes and a Hand.
	- Hand Horace
		Head priest of the CoH in Zyclest City, he is a kind Warlock who gladly offers aid to all who need it in the city. With the help of Eye Lilly and Eye Sen they take care of most of the sick or infirm in Zyclest City functioning as its primary hospital.
- Shrines to [[Mordechai]]
	The charred remains of letters, notes, and entire research journals lie at the feet of the very humanoid looking statue.
- Temple to [[Mammon]]
	Built by Barley Stoneshire father of Bradley Stoneshire, this extremely gilded and glorious temple lies smack in the center of the richer district where the rich and pious can make large offerings of Bits, Slivers, Gold and precious gems in the hopes of increasing their future wealth tenfold. There is a functioning priest here by the name of Grubson but he does little besides sit behind the collection counter and eat all day.
