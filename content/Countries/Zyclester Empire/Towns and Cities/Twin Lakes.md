# Description

Just a glance away from the [[Ashari]] border, nestled in one of the Ashari Riverâ€™s many deltas lies Twin Lakes. Its namesakes course through opposing sides of town, faring trade between Ashari, Helva, and the [Zyclester Empire](Zyclester%20Empire.md). Twin Lakes provides an eclectic mix of architecture from almost every era of civilization, boasting houses several centuries old huddled between ongoing construction projects. The ease on trade that the Ashari River creates means Twin Lakes rivals [Zyclest City](Zyclest%20City.md) in commerce, if not in population. While the town is bustling all hours, most bodies moving through its streets and alleys do not call Twin Lakes home. Those who do make their habitat its diverse streets are a small but stable faction of business owners, shop keepers, and local politicians.
