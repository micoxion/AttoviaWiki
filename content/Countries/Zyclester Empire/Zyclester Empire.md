title: Zyclester Empire
date: 2024-06-27
---
One of the two largest nations on Attovia. Boasting rich fertile land thanks to the deltas formed by many rivers running through Zyclester. The Zyclester Empire takes pride in its magic and technology being one of the most generally advanced nations in both. 
Previously ruled by the recently deceased half-elf emperor [[Leduin Aearonian]], the empire is kept safe from both internal and external threats via their judicial organization the [[Chain Keepers]], and their powerful military.

# Government
Society in the empire generally favors merit, ability, and societal value. The emperor is no different, being selected by a table of judges during a rigorous series of tests. Every 5 years the current emperor is re-tested for legitimacy, if he fails, a test of selection is had the following year, while the table oversees the emperor's duties and gathers entrants.
## The Table
In the past the Table of Judges' formation was a rigorous process in which candidates of eclectic backgrounds and walks were considered heavily before a final decision was made. In modern times this process is not but a formality to appease the general populace. Everyone who's anyone knows that the table ensures its power by tightly controlling anyone who would attempt to take an empty seat. Their wealth and influence is considered heavily, their impact on the tables power is considered *most* heavily, and they are interviewed by the table several times before acceptance. Bringing in someone who might provide a more expansive view to the table's narrow vision is not longer tolerated.
There are 7 seats at the table to ensure that votes and decisions are never at an impasse when the table is full. Currently 2 seats are empty, and the search for new members is ongoing.
- Ellis Stone - Half Elf 
	Ellis was picked for the Table due to her connection with the Chain Keepers, and her history of successfully executed assassinations and operations that completely destroyed the [[Flush]] cracking industry and crime ring within [[Zyclest City]]. Her father was killed by the brat of a slum lord, and her vengeance was swift and complete.
- Tabitha Brentwood - Human 
	Tabitha is an anomaly at the table. A rare choice made purely on merit. Discovered by Maximilian as a street urchin when she was finally caught for playing tricks on the local upper crust with her unnaturally comprehensive knowledge of magic circles. She fiddles in her free time as an artificer, and is in charge of law in regards to magical items and experimentation. She is almost certainly the most intelligent person in the entire city.
- Maximilian Decker - Half Orc 
	The bastard son of a previous judge at the table. He is the level head in the room. Attempting to balance and unite the polarizing opinions in the room. When he is not keeping Ellis from slitting Bradley's throat, he is inspecting military documents, overseeing new weaponry projects, and pushing for an increase in their defense budget.
	Recently Deceased
- Bradley Stoneshire - Halfling
	If it was not for his vast wealth Bradley would have little reason to be a Judge. When his place was questioned, the mana pipes ceased function for an entire week, and no government budgets could be resolved until he was "properly apologized to". Though his means are nasty, cutthroat, and his attitude vulgar, his business acumen is no joke. The Zyclest Empire was floundering when the emperor was lost, and the only thing keeping the nation from going into complete anarchy is the tubby, red haired halfling peering over the top of the Table's edge.
- Cecilia Wickes - Human
	Cecilia is, put nicely, a politician. She is the face of the Table. When civil unrest rises she puts on airs, and parades about with Bradley's money, a new invention of Tabitha's, or "secret" projects launched by Ellis to quiet and appease the angry masses. Cecilia will do whatever it takes to ensure the Table's legitimacy is not questioned, even if it means shoving her compatriots under the cart.

## Military
Zyclest's military hierarchy is part of the reason they were so dominant during the Magic War. They were and still are highly organized and prioritize discipline extremely highly. Turncoats, and those who go AWOL are punished severely, often with a death sentence or permanent exile.
### Generals
There are 5 generals who oversee the Zyclest Military, 6 if you count the head of military research and development who has provisional power to the level of a general in their area.
- Military Research Division General: [[Glados Yuleheart]]
### Brigadier
Initially during their first year of the Magic War the brigadier position was simply the leading position of a regiment who's size was highly variable. But when the Zyclester Empire began to grow during their conquest the position was upgraded in power to that of a sub-general most often put in charge of a geographical area of military activity that could encompass a number of regiments anywhere from 5 to 20.
### Captain
Captains directly report to their Brigadier, and are in charge of a single regiment of a group of soldiers. A regiment's size varies based on its makeup generally consisting of roughly 100 men, less if the regiment is built of cavalry, and more if common foot soldiers.
