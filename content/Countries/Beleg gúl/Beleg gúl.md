Traditional, powerful and beautiful, the elven lands of Beleg gul span the frozen north, to the temperate meridian of Attovia. Unlike its ecosystems the populace of Beleg gul lacks diversity. Few non-elven citizens are allowed legal entrance, and those who are allowed must be prepared to face segregation, systemic racism, and laws built to favor their long lived rulers. Behind the mask of beauty, lies the ugly face of corruption.

# Government
Beleg g√∫l is the longest standing traditional genealogical monarchy, over 6 millennia of kings and queens have ruled the elven lands with fists of iron, and arms of care. There are 3 primary royal bloodlines. The Cundo in Ambar bloodline of kings and queens, the Ta man Arpata  bloodline, and the Thurin Cim bloodline.
### Cundo in Ambar
Guardian's of the World. A fittingly pretentious bloodline, self provided by those elves who first cared for the [[Birth and Fall of the Ambar Tree|reborn]] [[Ambar Tree]]. The Cundo in Ambar are direct descendants of those elves. They are the only elves with a right to the throne.
### Ta man Arpata
Those who walk beside. A few centuries after planting the seed of the Ambar Tree and themselves in modern day Beleg g√∫l a less pure bloodline was taken aside, named Ta man Arpata, and given the responsibility of becoming advisors to the Cundo in Ambar. Now several millenia later, the Ta man Arpata run much of the real government, under the guise of "assisting their pureblooded masters."
### Thurin Cim
Hidden Blade. Once Beleg g√∫l truly came into its own as a super power of Attovia, the Cundo in Ambar quickly realized they required help of a different kind to the Ta man Arpata. Through a questionable process of controlled "breeding" the elven rulers genetically optimized a group of elves with inherited skills and features which made them perfect infiltrators and assassins. 
### Current Ruler
Araval is the current king of Beleg g√∫l, he has 4 legitimate children, and an untold multitude of bastard sons and daughters. Some of these illegitimate children are inoculated into the Thurin Cim, deemed unfit to rule or advise, but their blood isn't so dirty that they can't kill for their father.
###### Legitimate Children
- Elulin (star song)
- Fingolfin (wise Finw√´)
- Elboron
- Cirion

# Political Status
### [[Ornsiire Empire]] 
The elves of Beleg g√∫l respect Ornsiire for their regimented society, and shrewd military prowess. Beleg g√∫l was partially responsible for enabling the up rise of the Ornsiire Empire, to this day they hold some sway in the political decisions made by the country.

### [[Claskarian Theocracy]]
Beleg g√∫l knows little about the Claskarian's, but they find their accepting culture frivolous, short sighted and simple minded.

# Cultural Quirks/Notes
### Slavery
Slavery though technically forbidden by law, is a rampant social issue in Beleg g√∫l. Due to racist policies, and the lack of non-elf representation, large amounts of slave labor and indentured servitude can be found across the nation.
### [[Those who Work Meyda|Meyda-work]]
Some of the most powerful singular mages in all of Attovia reside in Beleg g√∫l. The long lifespans of the elves provide an unparalleled mastery of magic. It is difficult to defeat a mage who has studied for 5 of your own lifetimes.
