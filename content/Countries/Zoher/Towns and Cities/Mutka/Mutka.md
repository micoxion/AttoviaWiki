Mutka is sandwiched between the largest contiguous forest in Zoher and a crook in the [[Dami River]]. Its not a major stop over on the way to Twin Lakes, it only boasts a small Shrine to [[Hormus]], and no major roads pass within several miles of their small hamlet. Despite this, the people of Mutka are quite happy. No through traffic makes for a simple life of sacrifice, and the quiet consistencies most citizens of the continent will never get to know.
