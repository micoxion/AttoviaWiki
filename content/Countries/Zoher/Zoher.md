The first recognized nation on Attovia. It functions as a theocracy with the[[ Church of Hormus]] as the religious organization in charge. Zoher has strong influence in its neighboring nations due to the presence of the Church of Hormus within them.
# Government
Both the Church of Hormus and the nation of Zoher are lead in most part by [[The Head Priest]]. The nature of the head priest's survival hinges on their dedication to not only their deity but to their people. Though the government is theocratic to its core, there is an element of meritocracy as the individual who leads is not divinely chosen, but must volunteer, be of sound mind and unwavering determination.
### Law
The law of the land is based off of the tenets of the Church of Hormus as outlined in [[The Book of Nefiqaddis]] under the first portion titled the Guidance of the Sacrificial. New writings or commands provided by the Head Priest are also considered law. These snippets are added to a singular book in which the full collection of the law is codified. It is updated each decade and rests in the Head Priest's temple. Its title: [[The Legislation Provided by Hormus and his Head Priests for the Proper Conduct of the Bereaved]]. 
# Festivals and Rituals
### Weddings
Zoher weddings have a litany of ancient traditions mirroring aspects of Hormus and the Church. 
##### Healing Bath
First thing in the morning in different portions of a [[CoH Temples]] the fiancés bathe in ceremonial healing baths that are synced via a special ritual.
##### Blindfolds
The two halves of the couple are blindfolded and take turns describing their partner while standing back to back. 
##### The Strength of Two
Then the couple are strapped to one another and a large milling stone by the forearms and must drag it the width of the arm pillars within the temple.
##### Protecting Palms
The couple takes turns standing in front of one another blocking a dull ceremonial knife with their palms.
##### The Couples Journey
Decided by the couple beforehand one of them lifts and carries the other seven times around the center of the room following a circle in the floor which mimics the Meyda-circle in its foundations.
##### A Balanced Relationship
Each partner creates a “heart” for the other. A simple decorative object made with one or more items that symbolize the relationship. The hearts are exchanged and placed on either side of a scale. The difference in weight is then offset with small carved marble ribs, a typical symbol of love among the Zoher. 
##### The Final Bond
The Contract of Bonds is formed explicitly in a “proper” Zoher wedding. A Church of Hormus Priest tattoos a Meyda-circle on the chosen body part, traditionally the torso, but anywhere is acceptable. Once the tattoos are completed the couple recite from [[The Book of Nefiqaddis]] completing the Meyda-work. The tattoos vanish slowly over the next 12 hours but show themselves in times of emotional highs. They can also be summoned by reciting a smaller more compact form of the original text.
##### Wedding Complete
When the Final Bond is over the Priest who has facilitated the wedding opens the front door of the temple and invites the couple out stating: "A so begins the true couples journey. Hormus go with you as you live a life of sacrifice."
