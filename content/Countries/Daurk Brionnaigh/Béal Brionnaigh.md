Here lies the maw of the great mountain, cross hatched with iron beams, peering past the results basin you can see iron track descend into darkness. Every few minutes a [[Scríobs|Scríob]] arrives to insert a new set of runes at the rune table. At other times another comes to take the result of his latest instructions from the results basin. Next to the giant opening lies a small door which has not been opened for more than a couple centuries. Massive chains wrap its frame, and a several sets of [[Rugadhian Steel]] locks ensure its closure. A near constant stream of metal work streams forth into the results basin: Breastplates, warhammers, simple cutlery, candelabras, spear tips, shields and about any other military or mundane item one could produce at a forge. Though the output is large, the influx of Scríobs rushing to retrieve results ensures the basin does not fear for overflow.
