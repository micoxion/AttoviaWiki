Originally the [[Rugadh Sliabh|Rugadhian]] population had no access to magic, built from pre-sundered earth they were unmatched in craftsmanship but were easily incapacitated by enemy spellcasters. [[Aoire Sléibhe|Aoire Sléibhe's]] last creation was the clan of the Sochraide. A group of all female magic users who became a Rugadhian vanguard against the hordes of the [[Goweh]]. In the current era there are very few left of the Sochraide bloodline, now during [[Daurk Brionnaigh|Daurk Brionnaigh's]] time of peace they function more as public servants than warriors of any kind. Those who believe they are cursed, [[Scríobs]] who require help with enchantments, and any other magic queries and troubles are brought to your local Sochraide.
