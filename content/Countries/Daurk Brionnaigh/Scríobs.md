[[The Craft Mind]] can not speak a sentient language like other races. It must be communicated with using specialized runes. When a [[Master Cruthman]] needs the Mind to create many copies of a new sword they have invented they turn to a Scríob. There are 32 unique runes that allow for the full algorithmic description of the forging process. A Scríob's job is to master this specialized language so as to be able to describe any forge related process, from simple silverware to the miniscule filigree flowers of a paladins war hammer.
