# Description
The origin of the [[Frihet River]] lies on the western side of town, its origin a deep subterranean lake. Due to the rivers origins it emits a strong sulfur like smell similar to that of rotten eggs. The town is small but busy, the miniral rich fields here making them the grain capital of [[Kingdom of Helva|Helva]]. Substantial trade is made via the Frihet River to the [[Shen Dynasty]] supplying more than half the grains imported by the gnomish dynasty. 
A town of agriculture, what Lemu lacks in variety it makes up for in its efficiency. Most of the population is involved in the farming or trade process. Only essential businesses survive and they are kept busy year round.
