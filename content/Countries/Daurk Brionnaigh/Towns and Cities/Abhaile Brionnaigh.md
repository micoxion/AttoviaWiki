	Test and failed products from the Béal Brionnaigh all wind up here at Chester's, Chester is a non-native, a halfling in fact.
- Potion Master
	A sweet older Rugadhian woman named Ciara (Kee-ra) runs a limited selection of potions and tinctures, they run a high price as they are a rare commodity in the area.
- Orla's
	Full [[Master Cruthman]] and [[Scríobs]] supplier. Here you can find everything a Cruthman and Scríob duo would need to get started, many Scríob's move in and out purchase sets of instruction runes, or retrieving new hammers, anvils, Fullers or anything their Cruthman might need.
	Run by Orla, a very busy, out of breath Rugadh who is a bit skinnier than the rest of her kin.
- Shoppe of the Flame
	A bit of a pretentious general store owned by a bit of a pretentious Rugadh named Cromwell Burdock.
###### Taverns
