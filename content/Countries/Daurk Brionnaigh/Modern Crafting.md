After the invention of [[The Craft Mind]] the Dwarven craftscape changed forever. Time no longer needed to be wasted collecting ore in dangerous mines, or smelting it. In fact anything repeatable including the creation of weapons could be automated entirely. No Rugadh needed to make hundreds of identical swords, instead if he could make one perfectly he could tell the Mind how to make it and only weeks later the order would be finished. Society shifted, favoring those with an eye for exacting detail and precise workmanship. Those who could not compete became farmers, merchants, guards, or [[Scr√≠obs]].
