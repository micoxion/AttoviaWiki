<hr>

Daurk Brionnaigh is home of the [[Rugadh Sliabh]]. Its borders consist primarily of [[Darkmount]] Mountain, and some small stretch of farmlands near its base. Though the great mountain has not erupted for several hundred years the land is still black from Darkmount's active century. The soil at its base is still rich in nutrients allowing for a consistent, self contained food supply.

# Government
A council of elders presides at the head of all major decisions made for the people of Brion. The Rugadhian system of government has not changed in over a millenia, but their people's nature leads them to require little governing so long as craft and forge can be used and improved. 

### Punishments
There are 5 capital crimes in Brion. Each warrant's a decision of permanent exile or death.
1. Destruction of a recognized master work or relic
2. Attempted disruption of the [[The Craft Mind|Mind]]
3. Plagiarism
4. Murder
5. Rape

All other crimes are to be evaluated by [[The Council of Elders]] and the culprit punished accordingly.

# Political Status

### [[Claskarian Theocracy]]
Claskarian paladins and officials often commission special made weaponry from Brion. They have never complained with the result of any order, outside of timeliness. Rugadhians are prone to being perfectionists.

### [[Zyclester Empire]]
The Rugadhians have a testy relationship with the Zyclester Empire, as they attempted to haggle extremely low prices on bulk weaponry trade during a war. The Rugadhians do not take kindly to haggling, they will always price their work at an exacting worth.

### [[Ornsiire Empire]]
Weapon trade

### [[Kingdom of Helva]]
Weapon trade

### [[Shen Dynasty]]
Little to no interaction. The gnomes of the Shen Dynasty have little time to spend training for war.

# Festivals and Rituals
### Weddings
Rugadhian weddings are relatively down played compared to many other cultures. Due to the Rugadhian culture's suppression of emotive response weddings are often private or immediate family affairs in which several key traditions are conducted. 
- Carving the family Totem
	 The couple each take a chisel and hammer to a 2x3 foot cuboid block of stone. They each carve one half of the small totem often incorporating runes and imagery important to their family history and heritage. This often takes roughly 2 hours of non-stop work.
- Exchanging of rings
	 Before the ceremony the two lovers create a set of three rings each. Then during this portion they take turns braiding the custom rings into each other's beards. Each ring's material represents a different aspect of Rugadhian marriage:
	 **Gold:** The rarity of true love
	 **Silver:** Purity between partners
	 **Tungsten:** The strength of the marriage bond
- Request [[Aoire Sléibhe|Aoire Sléibhe's]] blessing on the couple.
### Christening a Masterwork
When [[The Council of Elders]] has deemed a Rugadh cruthman's work a masterwork for the first time a ceremony is held the following month once the cruthman's statue is complete. During the ceremony his statue is erected and the masterwork displayed in the statues hands overseen by the council to the fanfare of a Rugadhian choir and cheering crowd. 

# Cultural Quirks/Notes

### Signs and acts of respect
The utmost sign of respect in Rugadhian culture is the act of laying your smithing hammer or comparable tools at the feet of the one you are deferring to.
### Naming Convention
The number and order of a Rugadhian’s names can tell one a substantial amount about their life. When first born a Rugadh has one name given them by their parents. Their second name will almost always be their chosen profession. Rugadhian’s change profession extremely rarely, as there is some social taboo associated with it. One’s profession is believed to have been built into their person. Changing their profession implies they had been created faulty by Aoire Sléibhe. 
Further names could come from several other sources:
- Master. The leading name Master is granted to those in a profession who have been deemed by the Council of Elders to have achieved perfection in their craft. This is far less common in all professions that are not associated with the forge.
- Marriage. When two Rugadh marry, their first names become the last name of their new partner.
- Children. When a Rugadh has or adopts a child their name also becomes one of their names. In the case that one has children but is not married their profession remains their last name and the names of their children reside between it and their first.
