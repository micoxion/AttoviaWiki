When severed from the [[Ambar Tree]] Elves who pass from the material world who's [[Soul]] is substantial may leave it behind as a grim visage which seeks a new [[Ogen]] so it might attempt to regain its [[Tethers|Tether]] to the Ambar Tree. The strange nature of Elvish biology means that so long as a Naegra thÃ»l does not stray more than 5 miles from its body, the heart of the elf will keep it anchored for several decades, before finally, the [[World Stone]] draws the Soul to its final resting place.
