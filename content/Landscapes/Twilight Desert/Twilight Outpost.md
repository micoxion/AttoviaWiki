The only non-nomadic settlement that exists in the [[Twilight Desert]]. The sands are mingled with enough normal soil here that although ones eyes often feel funny, it is bright out enough to function with a sense of normalcy.
# Details
Population: 63
Governer/Leader: If anyone runs the Twilight Outpost its Elicdhir at the Trading Post.
City Scale (in miles): 2 square miles, spread thin
etc.
Economy: No one at the Outpost makes actual [[Chips]], the economy essentially functions from the trading of bottled [[Twilight Sand]], meaning anyone who doesn't own, run, or work for a business works as a Sand Panner, gathering sand to trade for goods and services. Functioning a lot like real world classic mining towns, it is difficult for anyone to leave since they are effectively trapped by company scrip.
# Buildings/Layout
## Shops
- Twilight Supplies 
	 The only general goods store, primarily exists to support and equip anyone traveling across the Twilight Desert.
	 Owned and run by a confident Dwarf by the name of Cormac, has left [[Daurk Brionnaigh]] due to differences with his fellow Dwarves.
## Inns/Taverns
- Twilight Inn
	 There isn't enough of a populace to support more than one inn/tavern combo. The Twilight Inn serves the only alcohol and spirits on tap, and has 5 rooms which are almost never full at the same time.
	 Owned and run by a female Dragon Born Dinara. Having moved here from her commune in [[Claskarian Theocracy|Claskaria]] she makes it her mission to spread the good news of the [[Kochavism]].

## Other
- Trading Post
	 A place where different purity levels of twilight sand are traded for imported goods from surrounding nations. Twilight Sand is so valuable that the outpost is rarely in need of precious food or water.
	 Functions as the local grocer, trading the imported goods for more harvested Twilight Sand.
	 Owned and run by a sleezy Half-elf Tiefling with protrusions almost like mandibles on both of his cheeks. His name is Elicdhir.
