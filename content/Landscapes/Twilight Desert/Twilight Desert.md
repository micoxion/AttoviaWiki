The sands of the Twilight Desert mysteriously absorb the majority of sunlight, the effect is so strong due to the scale of the sands that the sun can be looked at directly as the majority of its light is pulled into the gray desert. Then at night the sands steadily release the light they have accumulated during the day. The change in light levels during the day and night match remarkably well meaning the desert appears to perpetually exist in a state appearing like the twilight hour.
# Details
The sands are fine to travel on during their day cycle, however at night when the sands begin to release the energy they absorbed the 12 hours before they become scalding hot. Extended exposure with most materials renders leather burnt and in tatters, natural rubbers melted, and skin with third degree burns. Specialty boots can be bought at the [[Twilight Outpost]] trading post. These Panner Boots as their called by locals are magically enchanted to facilitate extreme insulation protecting the wearer's feet from major burns.
