The Nomads of the [[Twilight Desert]] are a peculiar people, always glowing with markings made from [[Geal Essence]], they wander the sands finding water where they can and trading [[Twilight Sand]], [[Twilight Fruit]] and Geal Essence for food and supplies. The Sand Panners from the [[Twilight Outpost]] respect them, and often will trade their used Panners to the Nomads in exchange for large quantities of Essence and Sand. The nomads are always in need of [[Chips]] and Panners as the Chips needed are hard to come by in the sparse desert.
