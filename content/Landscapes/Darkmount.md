A long dead volcano, home/origin of the [[Rugadh Sliabh]]. The interior of the mountain is a roiling metal mass of girders, supports, and steam powered automation. The Rugadhian's do not live inside the mountain any longer. That changed centuries ago after the metal mind was finished. [[The Craft Mind]] now resides within the mountain, repairing the inner workings of a now fully autonomous mining operation. The bustling industry of the mines and forges powered by the volcanoâ€™s magma is no longer available for the Rugadh to practice, but the fruits of the machine labor are theirs to reap. Small villages and cities dot the surface of the mountain where those exiled from Deep Home have honed out lives for their families.
