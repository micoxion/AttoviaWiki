Found exclusively in the [[Twilight Desert]], this sand's light absorbent properties makes it highly prized for certain classes of magical study, specifically that of chromatic spells, and some potion brewing. It is also a prized product for magical research conducted by students at Wizard academies.

# Acquirement Process
Sand from the Twilight Desert is pored through mesh cylinders lined with [[Chips]] called Sand Panners. The Twilight Desert that has absorbed sunlight will stick to the Chips along the walls of the Panner. The higher quality the Panner the higher and more denominations of Chips line its interior. Once a Panner has maxed out its capacity it is placed in a hand cranked centrifuge and spun until most of the sand has been spun off of the Chips within.
