Strangely lumpy fruits that grow from the fronds of trees surrounding the rare oasis in the [[Twilight Desert]]. These fruit do not glow externally, but once bitten into their flesh glows brightly! They cause one's mouth to behave as though bioluminescent for several hours. They also fill you with a warm fuzzy glow.
