# Introduction
Attovia is a homebrew world that was born during my time playing the TTRPG pathfinder. These days I run 5e with the hope to branch out into other systems. But Attovia was never intended to be a system specific setting and is a passion project of mine. This wiki is another way in which I am hoping to push myself to continue its creation and development. I likely won't be updating daily, but once to several times a week will likely be the norm, so if you are interested, check in consistently! There are many things written about that don't exist here yet because they are incomplete, spoiler rich, or not very readable yet. So part of the project is to simply get portions of the large vault into a state that I'm happy with them existing here.
As time goes on I will also be updating the look of the site as I learn more about Quartz 4.0 and the extent I can effect it.
# Guide
As the wiki grows exploration may begin to feel daunting, here are a few recommended places to start in the case that you want to dive in and click around and aren't looking for something specific.
##### Countries of Interest
- [[Daurk Brionnaigh]]
- [[Zyclester Empire]]
###### [[Pantheon]]
###### Magic System Fundamentals
- [[Tethers]]
- [[Meyda-flow]]
- [[Contracts]]
### Tag Key
- #Spoiler 
	If you see the Spoiler tag at the top of the page it should always be accompanied by one of the following: ðŸŒ¶, ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶, ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶. The spoiler spice meter as it were.
	#ðŸŒ¶ = Light spoilers, generally won't cause any kind of meta-game issues but simply something an in world character wouldn't know
	#ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶ = Medium spoilers, could be used to meta-game but not in any kind of story or game breaking way
	#ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶ = HOT Spoilers, this knowledge is volatile for a consistent player to know, may come with specific role tagged in which case those not tagged consider it medium
	These are of course only applicable if you think you might play in a game of mine any time soon. If that is not the case then sally forth curious [[Soul]]!
- #incomplete 
	Notes with the incomplete tag aren't *really* publish ready, but have information that isn't incorrect. They will often be quite short or small, but at least help flesh out more of the linking. Hopefully I can reduce the number of files that are tagged as such but we will see.
