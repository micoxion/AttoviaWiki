title: Welcome to Attovia
---

Attovia is a homebrew world that was born during my time playing the TTRPG pathfinder. These days I run 5e with the hope to branch out into other systems. But Attovia was never intended to be a system specific setting and is a passion project of mine. This sub is another way in which I am hoping to push myself to continue to push its creation and development. Every day I will drop a new piece of lore and/or information. I will start with many of the already created fundamentals but from there itâ€™s free reign! Whatever I want to create and in however much initial depth I want. I hope others might find this interesting but if not here is a fun record of what I did and when.
