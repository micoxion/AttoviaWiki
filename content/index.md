title: Welcome to Attovia

# Introduction
Attovia is a homebrew world that was born during my time playing the TTRPG pathfinder. These days I run 5e with the hope to branch out into other systems. But Attovia was never intended to be a system specific setting and is a passion project of mine. This wiki is another way in which I am hoping to push myself to continue its creation and development. I likely won't be updating daily, but once to several times a week will likely be the norm, so if you are interested, check in consistently! There are many things written about that don't exist here yet because they are incomplete, spoiler rich, or not very readable yet. So part of the project is to simply get portions of the large vault into a state that I'm happy with them existing here.
As time goes on I will also be updating the look of the site as I learn more about Quartz 4.0 and the extent I can effect it.
