Urubu is a moon to Attovia that has been tidal locked on two axis through means of powerful magic. Normally a tidally locked moon would still have phases, however the [[Platinum Orchid|Platinum Orchids]] that grow in the [[Urumuri|Platinum Dragon's]] presence so fully cover the surface of the planet that their brilliance causes the moon to glow every night, all night. It is considered one of the darkest omens when a thin strip of pitch black creeps over Urubu's visible surface. 
# Dragon Gravitas
Urumuri and [[Ubumnyama]] have [[God Stone|hearts]] so large and dense that their magical influence can exert power over the spin of Urubu. For seven millennia a power struggle of unprecedented scale has racked the planet with constant earthquakes and war. Countless generations of dragonborn leave nothing but their dull green blood on the planet as they are smashed into one another in the name of their gods honor.
