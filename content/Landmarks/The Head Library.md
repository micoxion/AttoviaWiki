An ancient library carved from the peak of (mountain name here). No one knows who built it originally, however it has become a mecca for all those who seek knowledge. Not always academic in nature many seek answers from childhood, family secrets, recipes, journal entries. The library is magical, any one book you desire can be found in its walls, it will guide you so long as your intentions are true, purity it cares for not. The climb to the library is arduous and dangerous, a monastic group who believe in the sacred nature of hidden knowledge defend the steep snow filled pathway with traps and ambushes. Though making the traversal a headache for weary travelers, it helps maintain a local guild of mercenaries who offer their services at a steep price to safely guide pilgrims up the mountain.
