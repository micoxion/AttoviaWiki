Attovia has other continents besides the larger mainland namesake. These smaller sparse landmasses are not **connected** to [[Hormus]] like the mainland. He has no contract with the soil elsewhere, so [[Graskoroth|Graskoroth's]] monsters make their home anywhere the conditions are not too extreme or harsh. Few denizens of Attovia know their are other places one could live.
