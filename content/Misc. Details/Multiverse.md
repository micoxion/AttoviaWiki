The greater Universe of Attovia has no multiverse. It is a single standalone timeline that exists alone its only realmic companionship the [[Luumara]]. The sentient process of choice and free will that would normally spawn the limitless timelines of a multiverse are the source of [[Meyda]]. The first [[Abbaki]] having seen the universe collapse into disarray once travel between multiverses was discovered, sought a way to snip the branches of the [[Tree of Time]]. Once they realized snipping would do no good they decided to burn it and remove its capacity to form branches all together. After they burned the tree itâ€™s still smoldering fragments exploded out into the universe as [[Ember|Embers]]. The Abbaki now comb the galaxies of their universe in search of these fragments in the hopes of growing a new Tree of Time under their control, bending it and subsequently the multiverse to their will.
