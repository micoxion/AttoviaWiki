During the [[Rugadh Sliabh|Rugadhian]] golden age of craftsmanship, the Rugadh used the hot belly of [[Darkmount]] to fashion armaments of unmatched quality. Here in the very depths of the mountain around her heart a sprawling capital hewn from the stone itself lay. A paragon of industry, a beacon of Rugadhian pride and a long distant memory. The Rugadh dug deep, requiring more furnaces and using more ore and magma than the [[Nephesh]] of the mountain would allow. Its ancient [[Soul]] awoke and a massive lumbering form of rock and flaming lava larger than the great shepherds of old descended on the unexpecting civilization. The Rugadh fought the mountain for over a year, using their incredible minds to slow and harry the creature at every step. It was [[The Architect]] who finally brought the great Soul to its knees, thus christening his weapon [[Fathach Bristeoir]] in the [[Meyda]] which poured forth. However, it was too late. The rubble of that glorious city their sole reward.
