The [[Krest]] were [[Lielun|Lielun's]] own attempt at making a people of her own. Not having an [[Ember]] from which to create life and consciousness she left the skies wooed and had relations with a human man, and from her womb the first Krest was born. The Krest were seen as strange devils by the early species of Attovia and were hunted to near extinction, the remaining few live far from most societies due to continued persecution.
