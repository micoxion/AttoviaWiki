Are those stars? I remember being considered. I remember being feared, relished, hated, despised, ignored, denied and forgiven. But who could forgive me? I knew no one. I was no one. Until now? The stars twinkle in front of me. There is a front of me? This is new, this space, this tangible intangibility, an empty wholeness stretches before me. Ah, before me, mirrored lights twinkle. What is this? Small cube forms of more tangible intangibleness lay in cute rows, as if fighting the emptiness. They sprawl in the new front of me. The lights grow, they are quite bright, perhaps this is beauty? I remain motionless, I dare not touch the wholeness of this reality. The small boxes are gone, little square shapes remain. The only lights left wink at me, in the sky. I twitch, I stand, I stroll into the broken defense against intangibility and begin my work.
