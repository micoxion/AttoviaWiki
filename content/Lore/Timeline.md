| [[Kingdom of Helva Established]]                  | After the war many previously annexed or razed cities began to complain amongst eachother.

Before their Zoher and Zyclestian neighbors realized what had happened they had emassed enough populace to properly define borders. Due to the timing, no neighboring nations had time to waste not licking their own wounds, and so the Kindgdom of Helva became a long standing nation, with the first _elected_ monarch. | 2846 | ToR |
