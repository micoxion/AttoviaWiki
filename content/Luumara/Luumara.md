Luumara or planes, whatever one might call them, exist within Attovia's universe, however, not as one might expect. Luumara are variable in size, but do not overlap the space around them. Contrary to much research within the world, Luumara are not physical locations, and do not take up the amount of space they appear to. Luumara are a byproduct of condensed [[Meyda]]. In its [[God Stone|Solid State]] Meyda contains enough compressed information and mass to provide full simulated environments and worlds, with beings, sapience and complete consciousness. Beings born within a Luumara can leave it, and beings born in the material plane can enter them. Meyda is a lossless source of information and matter. 
The Luumara often form a localized cosmology of planes and dimensions wherever an [[Abbaki]] with an [[Ember]] decides to take up residence, but in many ways this cosmology is a sham, a weak reflection of the [[Tree of Time]] brought about through its own ashes. 
# Creation
Luumara come about in a few different ways. 
- Construction: It is possible to create a Luumara by informing the Meyda on how to arrange itself. Several planes of existence have been created by deities through this process. 
- Belief: Luumaras also appear due to consistent large scale subconscious belief. The feywild is one such place, existing in a portion of the World Stone due to the belief in mythical creatures, and a world they must live in. See [[Contracts]].
