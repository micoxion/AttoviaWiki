Worlds within crystals or pocket dimensions are most often referred to as Luumakheder, or simply kheder. Examples of small [[Luumara]] can be seen in many spells and magic items. Such as the space created by the spell Rope Trick. On occasion kheder are used to facilitate a transference of the consciousnessâ€™s information to a true Luumara such as the [[Dread Forest]]. Since obtaining a new direct [[Tethers|Tether]] to a Luumara is more difficult than finding something already **Tethered** this is the most common way to travel to and from them. 
Sometimes storage devices that utilize [[Fractalmancy]] are mistaken for gateways to kheder such as [[Gorb|Gorbâ€™s]] box of trinkets and bags of holding.
