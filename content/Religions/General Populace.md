The general populace not residing in a theocratic state or nation rarely participates in the rules and doctrine associated with traditional religion. Instead they may pray to a god of the [[Pantheon]] if it suits their immediate need or worry. Athletes make offerings to [[üåçWorld Building/Attovia/üòáDeities/Krag the Quick|Krag the Quick]] as a part of competition prep. Sailors curse or praise [[Lielun]] when seas are rough or fair. When someone is in need of healing they are taken to a local [[CoH Temples|Church of Hormus Temple]] and an offering will likely be made. Religion for the common man is transactional. Not to say there are no pious individuals, one can always find a group or sect that is deeply devoted to a god, and perhaps more so devoted to a leader who provides knowledge about their chosen deity. Not all such groups are cults, many exist as local church communities, impacting their fellow citizens positively. Other's like [[The M√°vros Church]] started in such a way, but grew quickly, leading to corruptible people in power, now seeking control over a sizable flock they could have hardly imagined before.
