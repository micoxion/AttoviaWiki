The Church of Hormus focusses heavily on their [[Hormus|god's]] sacrificial aspect. The only widely recognized religion with more warlocks than paladins or clerics, the majority of those who wish to pledge service to their deity perform a brutal ritual known as the "Tear" and become one of the Sundered.

# Tenets
The Church of Hormus (CoH) focuses its beliefs around the 7 body parts of Hormus that where ripped from him during [[The Great Conflict]]. Each body part represents a different aspect of Hormus' benevolence which allows for a very wide variety of foci for believers. The seven parts and their related concepts are listed below:
- Eye: Healing
- Head: Knowledge
- Arm: Power
- Hand: Protection
- Foot: The Journey
- Leg: Balance
- Torso: Vitality
Aside from the individual body part focus the CoH teaches that sacrifice is key. If one is attempting to follow the tenets of the Eye but is unwilling to sacrifice to do so, then they are often considered unfaithful or struggling in their faith.

# Books

# World Builder Notes
Hormus' body parts are located all across the continent of Attovia. His gargantuan eye lies staring at the sky in the [[Grask Forest]] and is the most commonly known part. However, other parts lie in other places their residual power causing strange effects wherever they lie. The Foot is beneath the sands of the [[Twilight Desert]], and [[üåçWorld Building/Attovia/üèîLandmarks/The Head Library|The Head Library's]] foundations are built from his skull.
