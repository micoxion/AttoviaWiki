The Church of Hormus focusses heavily on their [[Hormus|god's]] sacrificial aspect. The only widely recognized religion with more warlocks than paladins or clerics, the majority of those who wish to pledge service to their deity perform a brutal ritual known as the "Tear" and become one of the [[Sundered Priests]].
Followers of the religion generally refer to one another and themselves as “The Bereaved”. Generally not associated with any tenet of the belief in regards to grief or sorrow, but attributed to the fact that their god’s physical body is considered deceased after his penultimate sacrifice.
# Tenets
The Church of Hormus (CoH) focuses its beliefs around the 7 body parts of Hormus that where ripped from him during [[The Great Conflict]]. Each body part represents a different aspect of Hormus' benevolence which allows for a very wide variety of foci for believers. The seven parts and their related concepts are listed below:
- Eye: Healing
- Head: Knowledge
- Arm: Power
- Hand: Protection
- Foot: The Journey
- Leg: Balance
- Torso: Vitality
Aside from the individual body part focus the CoH teaches that sacrifice is key. If one is attempting to follow the tenets of the Eye but is unwilling to sacrifice to do so, then they are often considered unfaithful or struggling in their faith.
