The [[Church of Hormus]] does not generally deal in the prophetic or the process of divining the future. Considered fatuous by most believers, and a general waste of time by the rest. There is however, one piece of prophecy granted to the worshipers of [[Hormus]]. It plays heavily into their eschatological beliefs, and is widely considered the only exception of prophetic vision. Even as an exception though, the Prophecy of the Shaken World is still rarely a point of focus for devotees past general knowledge and perhaps rote memorization.
# The Prophecy
When Ember's spark lights Meyda's egg the shell will sunder loud.
The son arise from shaken world and pass between the stars.
Rivers of flame expose the soul and burn away untruth.
