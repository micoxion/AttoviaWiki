More colloquially known as the Cult of Akhar the M치vros Church is one of the largest named [[Dragons|Dragon]] cults and hosts roughly 1300 members spread across a number of locations, with the vast majority living in a large commune on the western edge of [[Claskarian Theocracy|Claskaria]]. They have a well defined hierarchy, and conduct regular rituals and rites that provide a structure and consistency that helps maintain numbers.
# Hierarchy
## Disciple
Upon completing the rite of initiation a new member becomes a disciple, the most common and lowest rung on the ladder of the cult. Disciple's take care of the commune or community they are in, doing mundane tasks and often serving directly under an Acrid Priest. Their duties entail everything from commonplace chores to ritual prep. On rare occasions an extremely important ritual will include a willing human sacrifice, these sacrifices are almost exclusively pulled from the plentiful pool of Disciples.
## Acrid Priest
Acrid priests are usually disciples who have set themselves apart in some respect, and their status is increased in exchange for planting and running a new M치vros Church. Acrid Priests must know the `number here` fundamental rites and rituals, and have some level of managerial skill. They are responsible for delegation, and ensuring the cult is not too heavily scrutinized by local governments.
## Shadow Disciple
The Shadow Disciple's are a small group of elite cult members who report directly to the Head Priest and no one else. They carry out his bidding with no questions asked.
## Head Priest
The head of the entire M치vros Church. Directs the ship as it were, and has total control over all proceedings.
