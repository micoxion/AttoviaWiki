Externally referred to as the Krakens Cult, or more long form the Cult of the Kraken, internally this group of [[Graskoroth]] worshipers refer to themselves as **Those who Seek the Deep** or **Divers** when connecting/meeting in public. The end goal of the cult is to bring Grask back into power. The means is difficult though, it requires a ritual to adjust or remove the [[Contracts|contract]] between [[Hormus]] and Attovia. The majority of the cults funds and proceedings are funneled towards the research required to conquer this hurdle. 

# Internal Politics
The CotK has existed in small for several thousand years and has amassed large quantities of wealth and leverage in most majorly developed nations. Some time around [[Eraâ€™s of Attovia|2800 AN]] the internal structure was hijacked by a small group who held the majority of the flow of [[Chips]]. Currently the cultâ€™s true hidden purpose is to fuel their eliteâ€™s lust for political power and wealthy lifestyle, but enough of the stream of income is diverted to ease the mind of any would be dissenter. And if a small bribe wonâ€™t do the job, a swift removal from service has proven indispensable.
