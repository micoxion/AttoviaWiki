Kochavism also known as The Star Gazers, so named after the method by which [[Urumuri]] sends her dragonborn to Attovia. Those first dragonborn who crashed to the earth some seven millennia ago walked Attovia's uncivilized lands spreading the word of their Queen who had set them free. Who deigned to light this blessed place by night spending every waking minute fending off the darkness of the other side of [[Urubu]], that most brilliant of moons who's light is shed from the brilliant [[Platinum Orchid|white flowers]] her beauty grows. It took thousands of years before enough Kochavists had gathered that their nomadic lifestyles finally settled down to form the nation of [[Claskarian Theocracy|Claskaria]]. Even now their nation is structured simply, but when attacked its people rise up with a divine fervor to protect their way of life. Utilizing their abnormally high number of sorcerers and naturally inclined guerilla warfare tactics, the nation has never been wiped out, though it has given up ground on more than one occasion.

Kochavists prioritize freedom. Urumuri has seen fit to grant them new life by sending them to her planet of birth, they will use that granted freedom to live a life free of shackles and obligations. The Great Platinum Dragon is praised by all Kochavists, but they are also free to follow and abide by any other religion so long as it is by choice, for this too is worship to the Brightmother.
