Hormus is the benevolent [[Abbaki]] creator of Attovia, parts of his colossal body can be found littering the planet, often subject to worship individually. One of the few lucky Abbaki to hold an [[Ember]] he has turned Attovia into his own chrysalis creating a number of sentient races to create a World Stone in which his consciousness finally resides after the results of [[The Great Conflict]]. The [[Meyda]] encoded form of Hormus still holds the power of the Ember and thus creatures who are given proper [[Tethers]] to the World Stone may be given sentience under unique circumstances. Unlike many other [[Pantheon|deities]] of Attovia Hormus has no interest in gathering followers, instead focused on the future of his people. He has no heralds or children, and is content to allow [[Contracts]] of Sacrifice and Belief to be made between him and those who worship him.
