Rugadhian steel is a specialized alloy of Mithril and Adamantium. Utilizing an extremely precise heating and folding process the two metals are turned into a miracle material with both the hardness of Adamantium and the light weight properties of Mithril. This alloy's creation process has only successfully been executed by the Rugadh Sliabh. It is thought by many that perhaps they are the only people who can. It drives the highest price per item of any metal, some pieces of equipment even selling for as much as entire estates and deeds to land. It generally goes unsaid that to become a [[Master Cruthman]] a Rugadhian will need to incorporate such steel into their creation.
