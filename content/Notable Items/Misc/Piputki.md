The Piputki is an instrument with ties to early [[Ashari]]. It is a long rectangular housing for many small reed pipes which a musician can use to play different notes. Though falling out of use in its home country, It is has grown in popularity in the [[Shen Dynasty]] in recent years due to its flexibility during creation. Specifically the Piputkiqin[^1]: A slightly longer version hosting two Pentatonic scales as opposed to the traditional singular Octatonic scale, it better reflects the musical practice of [[Gnomes|Gnomish]] society.
