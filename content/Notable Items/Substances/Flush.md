Flush is an incredibly powerful drug. It brings on a rush of extreme energy levels, and reduces stress to negligibility. Its greatest property however, is its magical nature which removes the crash one would expect after such a high. This not only makes it quite expensive, but also extremely addictive. Hosting the highest price per dose of any drug due to the difficulty in its creation. Some have found ways of producing it cheaper resulting in a more affordable but far more dangerous version known as Cracked Flush. The [[Zyclester Empire]] is heavily inundated with the substance due to their proximity to the [[Grask Forest]] where the most key ingredient resides: tears from the [[Eye of Hormus]].

    Flush:Â When a creature takes flush (sharp inhale through the mouth or nose) their mind immediately begins to race, and their productivity spikes. The said creatures str, dex, and con increase by 2 up to a maximum of 22 from this affect. They have advantage on con saves, and are resistant to non magical damage, and force damage. The drugs hold on the brain is partially magical meaning that the creature who consumed it is also immune to all charm affects. 1 dose lasts for 1d6 + 2 hours, after the affect wears off the creature rolls a d6, on a 1-5 they become addicted to flush. on a 6 they are not addicted and no further side affects occur. A creature addicted to flush experiences no withdrawal (due to the magical properties of the drug) for 1d20 + 10 days. After which if they have not taken any flush they receive the following conditions for 1d20 + 5 days: -2 to con, each day during the withdrawal symptoms the creature must make a DC 15 con save, if they fail they take a -2 to their maximum hit points, if they succeed they do not take the hit point penalty. The target must succeed on 1/3 of the con saves over the duration of the withdrawal, or they will experience a second bout of withdrawal after a day of deceptive recovery in which the creature regains its normal maximum hit points and its con modifier. The second bout lasts as long as the first did however the DC for the con save becomes 12 and the creature only takes a -1 to their con, each subsequent fail reduces the creatures maximum hit points by 1, and there is no 3rd bout of withdrawal.
    
    Cracked flush does not have the same withdrawal removal and the withdrawal symptoms are twice as bad, both removing twice as much of your con, hp, and lasting twice as long.
