Traditionally cubes but now more commonly dodecahedron's Spell Block's are most commonly used by [[Sorcerer|Sorcerers]] but many [[Those who Work Meyda|Meyda-workers]] use them as a focus aid. Each face of the Spell Block has a simplified version of a spell's [[Meyda-Circle]] with its lines deeply engraved allowing the holder to trace the circle with the thumb or forefinger during Meyda-work.
Several attempts have been made to create Spell Blocks with internal mechanisms that allow for dynamic Meyda-circle construction but the precision required has made all known attempts unusable. Students at the [[Zyclest City|Zyclester University]] often attempt to create modified Spell Blocks or Dynamic Spell Blocks as their final project.
