A beautifully crafted [[Rugadh Sliabh|Rugadhian]] war hammer, forged by hand in the magma of [[Darkmount]] before the time of [[The Craft Mind]], during what many Rugadh consider the golden age of craftsmanship. Fathach was used by [[The Architect]] during the [[Desolation of Deep Home]] in dispatching the massive stone [[Nephesh]] which raided their home. It has since been modified and enchanted to great power and precision by the Architect, to this day remaining a deadly weapon. 
Many denizens of [[Daurk Brionnaigh]] believe the weapon to be lost, sealed in cold magma miles below the lowest layers of the mountain.
