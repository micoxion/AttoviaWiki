The majority of monsters do not bleed. Without the normal biology that normally keeps a creature alive, [Graskoroth](Graskoroth.md)â€™s hatred forms a kind of lesser [Minor Stone](Minor%20Stone.md) which supplies the monster with all the energy necessary for life. This does not mean that monsters do not hunger, born of hate and rage, they often have insatiable appetites, which drive them to hunt sentient creatures.
