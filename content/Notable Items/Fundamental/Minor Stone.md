A Minor Stone is created in much the same way as itâ€™s bigger brother the [[God Stone]] except that Minor Stones are usually the result of intention, or strong emotions. Minor Stones are capable of similar magical capacity to God Stones, but with a fraction of the output. Thus Minor Stones cannot be used to cast powerful spells, do not have any kind of area effect, and are much more common. There are some cases of Minor Stones being found in the foundations of old buildings, usually where many people would have gathered prior. Theatres and Churches are the most common locations in which this has occurred. Where there is long standing focus and agreement on an established entity and its purpose, there will likely be a Minor Stone.
