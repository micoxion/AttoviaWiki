Chips are the most common currency on Attovia. Found in all [[True Monsters]] the chip retains value due to its intrinsic magical properties, and the comforting knowledge that a chip represents one less goblin to haunt your fields. 

## Denominations

- Shard: Made from crushing a Chip via mechanical or magical force. Roughly 20 Shards make a chip.
- Chip: 100 Chips make a bit
- Bit: 10 Bits make a Sliver
- Sliver

At and after CR 13 most monsters are so much more powerful that if a stone does reside in their body (and they havenâ€™t removed it to make more practical use of its energy) it is a [[God Stone]].
