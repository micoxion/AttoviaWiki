God Stone's are formed when a very large amount of [[Meyda]] is released in a very short amount of time. The coalescing of this information dense matter hardens into what is known as a God Stone. God Stones vary in their magical power based on both their size, and the potency of the magic making them up. However, they are all extremely powerful. Unlike their duller [[Minor Stone]] counterparts God Stone's often glow quite brightly, most commonly a shade of blue or purple God Stone's can range across the visible spectrum of light and even in some rare cases the infrared. Many of Attovia's most intelligent have devoted their entire lives to studying these stones, some spending the majority of their lives just to obtain one. Some notable uses include the binding stones used on the [[The Hebdomad|Seven Demon Lords]] of old, facilitating travel to and from the [[Luumara]], many legendary magical items, and more recently the God Stone powered [[Meyda]] lines in [[Zyclest City]].
